    <h2>Using Cryogen for Website</h2>
</div>
<div id="post-body">
    
    <p>Ever since resurrecting my personal website, I have experimented with several static website generators. Thus far, I have used <a href='https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page'>org-page</a>, <a href='http://jekyllrb.com/'>Jekyll</a> (<i>several</i> times), and even made (sort of) <a href='https://github.com/himmAllRight/ryBlog/blob/master/org-blog.el'>my own emacs org-page solution</a>. Now that I have started using <a href='http://clojure.org/'>clojure</a>, I have come across <a href='http://cryogenweb.org/'>cryogen</a>. As you might have guessed, this site is now being generated using cryogen.</p><p><!&ndash; more &ndash;></p><h2><a name="emacs/org-mode&#95;solutions"></a>Emacs/org-mode Solutions</h2><p><img src="../../img/posts/using-cryogen-for-website/Emacs-icon.png" alt="emacs logo" /> <img src="../../img/posts/using-cryogen-for-website/org-mode-unicorn.png" alt="org-mode unicorn" /></p><p>When I revitalized my personal website, my obsession with <a href='https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/'>emacs</a> (and more importantly, org-mode) eventually led me to try out <a href='https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page'>org-page</a>. The idea of writting web pages and blog posts in .org files was <i>very</i> appealing. Overall, org-page was nice, but I found the documentation and support to be lacking. It seemed to be more of a [personal project](http://kelvinh.github.io/), rather than a fully supported framework. while I know <a href='http://cmacr.ae/'>other people</a> were able to get it working, org-page simply wasn't working for me.</p><p>For over a year now, I have used org-mode at work each week to track my time and take notes. I then export the org files to html, creating a full index of my work notes/logs. After digging deeper to figure out how org-page worked, and realized it was just a fancy wrapper around the org-project functions I already used. So, I decided to implment <a href='https://github.com/himmAllRight/ryBlog/blob/master/org-blog.el'>my own emacs org-page solution</a> (well, <i>half</i> implement. I guess I never fully finished it...). While creating my own solution helped me learn more about org-page (which helped with my work notes), I ultimately abandoned this method for my personal website. Using my own solution quickly became a pain because any computer I wanted to generate and publish the site from had to have a <i>.emacs</i> file set up <i>just right</i> to work.</p><h2><a name="jekyll"></a>Jekyll</h2><p><img src="../../img/posts/using-cryogen-for-website/jekyll.png" alt="jekyll logo" /></p><p>My first experience with <a href='http://jekyllrb.com/'>Jekyll</a> was about two years ago, right after I graduated college. It was the first true static website generator that I tried and I absolutely loved the concept. You see, I taught myself how to build websites in the early to mid 2000's when I was in middle school, and apparently never developed beyond that point.During college, I maintained a personal site by hand. It was super simplistic html that used tables for the layout, and css for coloring. That's about it. Using a static website generator like Jekyll for the first time was amazing, since it automatically produced static webpages that looked <i>much</i> better than anything I could do by hand. It was what my 12-year-old-self longed for. I eventually stopped using Jekyll because I was unable to get the theming quite right, and ... well ... I started <i>really</i> getting into emacs. But you've already heard that story.</p><p>After taking a breif hiatus from Jekyll to adventure deeper into emacs land, I return. This time, I was able to find and configure a <a href='https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno'>sick theme</a> that fit my needs. My personal website looked the best probably ever has, and I really enjoyed it. However, I have recently gotten frusterated using Jekyll (again). It is great static website generator, but because I don't often develop in Ruby (right now), setting up the proper ruby gems environment and dependencies on <a href='../../pages/homelab/'>my computers</a> can be very frusterating. Additionally, I have been learning <a href='http://clojure.org/'>clojure</a> and while digging through different clojure projects, I found <a href='http://cryogenweb.org/'>cryogen</a>.</p><h2><a name="cryogen"></a>Cryogen</h2><p><img src="../../img/posts/using-cryogen-for-website/cryogen.png" alt="Cryogen logo" /></p><p><a href='http://cryogenweb.org/'>Cryogen</a> is a static website generator written in <a href='https://clojure.org/'>Clojure</a>.  If you already have <a href='http://leiningen.org/'>Leiningen</a> installed (which if using Clojure, you should), starting a new Cryogen application is as easy as entering <code>lein new cryogen project-name</code> into a terminal. Once the project is created, you can <code>cd</code> into the directory and run `lein ring server`. Clojure will then fire up a local webserver of the compiled project (by default on port 3000). Whenever a change made to a project file is saved, the cryogen server re-compiles the project and updates the webserver. As a result, makes it easy to edit see changes live. Cryogen has a rather large, but simple [directory structure](http://cryogenweb.org/docs/structure.html) that is used to organize the project. Coming from Jekyll, this takes a bit of getting used to, but I think it helps keep everything organized once you learn it.</p><p>The one thing I <i>really</i> like about Cryogen is the fact that... well... it's clojure. This means that things can feel more "lisp-y" from time to time. For example, in Jekyll, the preferences and configuration of the website are kept inside a yaml configuration file. Similarly, the meta-data and information for a page or blog post are defined in a very specific yaml header at the top of the markdown files. Cryogen follows a similar concept, except instead of yaml headers, cryogen simply uses a p-list for it's <a href='http://cryogenweb.org/docs/configuration.html'>configuration setup</a>.</p><p>To change a post's information (ex: title, author, date), simply change the keywords in the list at the top of the post's markdown file. The flexability of setup also means that figuring out show to setup use my own configuration was a breeze. For programmers that have previously used Clojure or LISP in general, the configuration in Cryogen is very intuitive and very natural.</p><p>The only <i>downside</i> (sort of) I have experienced while using Cryogen is that being a smaller community, there isn't much out there in terms of templetes and themes (at least that I was able to find). So, while I was able to easily setup an amazing looking website using Jekyll (by using someone else's theme), I am forced to be a bit more hands on using cryogen. Initially, I thought this was a negative, but after spending some time hacking away at the theme and cleaning off my rusty css/html skills, I think I have the site looking <i>good enough</i> for now. As a bonus, I am starting to re-learn web design. However, I am <i>slowly</i> catching up, so "modern" design features like mobil support might not happen right away. It's not the best looking site, but I like and and think it gives off a personal touch, which I guess is good in a personal website. </p><p>That's about it. That's why my site suddenly looked different one weekend. I look forward to using both Clojure and Cryogen more for not only this website, but other personal projects as well.</p>
