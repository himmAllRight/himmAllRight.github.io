                    <p>After a decade of using several combinations of <em>dual</em> monitors, I
have decided to upgrade to using a single, but <em>better</em>,
monitor. After two years of debating, I have finally made my choice.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="monitor-history">Monitor History</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/pre-college-monitors.jpg"><img alt="Pre College monitors" src="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/pre-college-monitors.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">My monitor setup right before moving to college</div></p>

<p>Half way through high school, I purchased my first laptop (it also happens to
be the first computer I installed Linux on. I had a special edition model, but it was
very similar to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/products/hp-pavilion-dv6000/specs/">this
one</a>). The laptop was
replacing an old standard E-machines desktop, so I kept the spare monitor to
use with the laptop. From that point on, I <em>usually</em> had two screens to look
at, even if one was just my laptop&rsquo;s screen at the far end of my desk, with an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)">AIM</a> window open in it. Before
moving to college, I built a desktop computer with a new monitor (picture
above), and utilized the old one as a secondary display.</p>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/college-desk.jpg"><img alt="College Desk" src="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/college-desk.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; padding: 10px;"/></a>
<div class="caption">My desk during my senior year of collage</div></p>

<p>Throughout college, as I started to explore Linux and programming more,
I began to experiment with using monitors in portrait orientations.
Eventually, I purchased a second 23.6&rdquo; 1080p monitor so they would
match when paired. This gave me much more vertical real estate, which was
useful when writing code, essays, or lab reports.</p>

<h2 id="why-go-from-two-to-one">Why go from two, to one?</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/homelab/kadabra1.jpg"><img alt="MA Desk" src="../../img/homelab/kadabra1.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; padding: 10px;"/></a>
<div class="caption">When using two monitors, I always had to have a primary and secondary.</div></p>

<p>While I like having the <em>screen real estate</em> of two monitors, I was never able
to optimally use them because of the bezels between the monitors.  While
working, I would naturally shift over and use one monitor as a <em>primary</em>
display, and the other as a <em>secondary</em> display. This was okay for some tasks,
but it usually just meant that I just used the primary monitor, and <em>half</em> of
the secondary one, because it was too hard to see the far end of the screen.</p>

<p>This issue was <em>slightly</em> better when using my displays in portrait mode, but
that wasn&rsquo;t always ideal when connecting to remote machines, or viewing wide
content (videos, for example). It also didn&rsquo;t solve the main issue. When
looking at the screens in a natural position (head centered, looking strait
forward)&hellip; I still saw two pieces of black plastic. I wanted to see my
<em>primary</em> window directly in front of me, with some auxiliary space on either
side for documentation and terminal windows. I wanted a wide screen display.</p>

<h2 id="ultra-wide-or-large-16-9-uhd">Ultra-wide or <em>Large</em> 16:9 UHD?</h2>

<p>Luckily, the once <em>extremely</em> expensive ultra-wide and large UHD monitors have
started to come down in price. After following the market for a few years, I
narrowed my decision to my favorite choice in each category: The <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-34-curved-ultrawide-monitor-u3415w/apd/210-adtr/monitors-monitor-accessories">Dell
u3415w</a>
and the <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-43UD79-B-4k-uhd-led-monitor">LG
ud4379b</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/dellu3415w.jpg"><img alt="Dell u3415w" src="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/dellu3415w.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The Dell u3415w 34&rdquo; 3440x1440p Ultra Wide Monitor </div></p>

<p>The Dell u3415w is the slightly older (compared to the
<a href="https://www.dell.com/ed/business/p/dell-u3417w-monitor/pd">u34<strong>17</strong>w</a>) 34&rdquo;
ultra-wide monitor offering from Dell. It has a 3440x1440, 60 Hz,
slightly-curved, IPS panel sitting on a solid and adjustable monitor stand. I
preferred it over other ultra-wides because it could be found for a reasonable
price, and had a professional build quality.</p>

<p>Based on my reasoning explained in the section above, an ultra-wide (1440p
ones&hellip; not 1080p) would fit my mostly programmer use-case very well. Being a
single monitor, I could position it directly in front of me, with my main
code/content centered. The 3440px wide resolution would also allow enough
horizontal space to have a full web page of documentation, and several terminal
windows open on either side of the main display. Lastly, the 1440px vertical
resolution would be an adequate improvement from my <em>&ldquo;starting to feel tight&rdquo;</em>,
1080p monitors.</p>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/ud4379b.jpg"><img alt="Dell u3415w" src="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/ud4379b.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The LG ud4379b 42.5&rdquo; 3440x2160p Monitor</div></p>

<p>The massive LG ud4379b is a 42.5&rdquo; 3840x2160px IPS display. At this size and
resolution, it is roughly the equivalent of having four 21&rdquo; 1920x1080px
monitors aligned in a 2x2 grid&hellip; except with 0 bezel between them. Compared to
other 40&rdquo;+ 4K displays, I preferred this one because once again, it was
reasonably priced, had great input options, and also seemed to have a half
decent panel. Reviewers consistently said it had vibrant colors and minimal
back light bleed.</p>

<p>Being single monitor, I could easily sit myself in front of it, and have my
main content centered, just like with the ultra-wide. Being so large, I could
still have auxiliary windows opened on either side. One advantage the ud4379
had over the ultra-wide however, was that being a massive 16:9 screen, it could
easily be divided into 4 1080p screens. In fact, this model supports spitting
the screen into four separate displays, each taking a different input (more on
that later..). While the ultra-wides often support splitting and
picture-in-picture, it seems more natural on the 43&rdquo; monitor.</p>

<h2 id="deciding-on-the-43-uhd">Deciding on the 43&rdquo; UHD</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/multi-input.jpg"><img
alt="Shipped Box" src="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/multi-input.jpg"
style="max-width: 100%;"/></a> <div class="caption">The LG ud4379 can support
multiple inputs at a time to the single display</div></p>

<p>I went back and forth on which monitor I wanted several times. Eventually, I
realized the long term versatility of the LG monitor was just something I could
not ignore. Being able to use it as one massive display that I could fit
several full VM windows in, or even as 1,2, or 4 discrete monitors makes it
extremely useful for me. I tend to be playing with more than one computer or VM
at a time, and it is VERY nice to have them all fit on a single display. I
<em>was</em> worried it would be a bit <em>too</em> large and look stupid on my desk,
especially compared to how slick the ultra-wide would look. However, in the
end, practicality won out.</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-ud4379b">Getting the UD4379b</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/box.jpg"><img alt="Shipped Box"
src="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/box.jpg" style="max-width:
100%;"/></a> <div class="caption">The Monitor arrived a few days later
perfectly safe, despite the beat up box</div></p>

<p>After deciding that we would likely order the monitor as my birthday gift, my
wife and I started watching the price a few weeks before. One day, we noticed
the price had dropped $200&hellip; so we ordered it. The price soon went back up, so
I&rsquo;m glad we snatched it when we did!</p>

<p>It came a few days latter in a massive box that I happily carted up to our
apartment. The box was a bit beat up, but after opening it, all the components
were fine.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-like">What I like</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/monitor-working.png"><img alt="Monitor Working" src="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/monitor-working.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">I can have my main content front and center, with other windows on the sides</div></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Screen Resolution</strong> - The most obvious pro using a monitor at this
size and resolution&hellip; is the screen real estate. As explained above, it&rsquo;s
twice the space of my old, dual 1080p monitor setup. With this space, I can
easily have several source code files, documentation, a few terminals, a
chat window, and even a video opened on my single screen as I work.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>IPS Display</strong> - Many people might assume that the driving factor
pushing me to <em>finally</em> update my monitors was my desire for more screen
resolution. While that was <em>part</em> of my goal&hellip; what truly motivated me was
a desire to switch to an IPS display on my main setup after almost a year
using my T470&rsquo;s IPS display (which by the way, is <em>not a good IPS panel</em>).
As someone who spends a large percentage of their computing time in dark
terminals and IDEs, an IPS panel really does help text and colors to pop,
because the darks look <em>so</em> much better. It turns out, this panel is
actually quite good for it&rsquo;s price, and I am very happy with it.</p>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/new-monitor.jpg"><img alt="Monitor Shading" src="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/new-monitor.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">When working, I can look straight at a single display and still have enough room.</div></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Single Monitor, No (center) Bezels</strong> - As explained earlier in this
post, I like that this is is a <em>single</em> monitor. This means that I no
longer need to twist my head back and forth, or stare at bezels. I can
looks straight ahead and see my main content, with &ldquo;auxiliary&rdquo; windows
view-able in my periphery.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Flexibility, multiple inputs</strong> - Lastly, I enjoy the multiple
inputs and excellent PIP system of this monitor. Combined with something
like <a href="https://symless.com/synergy">Synergy</a>, I can easily use this one
display with several devices at a time. This is great when working with
more than one device, or potentially watching content on something like a
chromecast stick, while still working on the computer. It really is the
advantage of having 4 monitors, but in a single package.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Speakers</strong> - They aren&rsquo;t <em>amazing</em>, and I don&rsquo;t use them too often
too often, but for &ldquo;monitor&rdquo; speakers, they really aren&rsquo;t half bad. They&rsquo;re
what you&rsquo;d expect from a TV. However, this means that if I were to use
something like a media stick, the built-in speaker is acceptable enough for
such a device.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-i-don-t-like">What I don&rsquo;t like</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/monitor-shading.png"><img alt="Monitor Shading" src="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/monitor-shading.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Viewed from the center, the monitor edges have shadowing.</div></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Edge Shadowing</strong> - The one issue that myself
<a href="https://youtu.be/yA6hL3inqRc?t=250">and</a>
<a href="https://youtu.be/3BSaPRHrA_U?t=667">others</a> have experienced with
this monitor is a sort of &ldquo;edge shadowing&rdquo;. This is apparently
something that is common on monitors this massive, and it&rsquo;s
really hard to engineer around. If I sit back far enough from the
display, you can&rsquo;t see it anymore. (But I don&rsquo;t normally sit like that)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Input Switching Lag?</strong> - While this is more of a critique of
<em>monitors</em> in general, one thing I wish was a bit better was the input
switching. Having so many inputs, it can get confusing remembering which one is
attached to what device, or trying to quickly configure a 2x2 multi-input
layout. Having to <em>wait</em> for each device to connect when flipping through all
the inputs makes it that much more frustrating (and disappointing when it&rsquo;s the
wrong input&hellip;).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Corners Out of View</strong> - Being such a large display, one issue I
sometimes have is that the outside corners are out of my field of view.
I mostly notice this when I occasionally miss notification pop-ups
that I <em>want</em> to see. On the flip-side, notifications don&rsquo;t seem to
distract me as much now when I&rsquo;m trying to focus :P.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/new-monitor-desk.jpg"><img alt="Monitor Shading" src="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/new-monitor-desk.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">New monitor on my desk.</div></p>

<p>In conclusion, I an <em>very</em> happy with my new monitor. It fits all of the
criteria I had, and works for my use-case perfectly. While I wouldn&rsquo;t
recommend it for a pure gaming machine, it might be one of the best deal
<em>productivity</em> monitors out there.</p>
