                    <p>Over the past few years (particularly after moving to the <a href="../../post/my-t470/">T470</a>
as my main device), I have been anticipating what my next desktop
workstation build will look like. For a period of time, I was convinced that
I would build a <a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/1155-affordable-dual-xeon-pc/">muti-socket, used xeon
build</a>. Then, in 2017
AMD released their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen">Ryzen</a>
series CPUs&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="why-a-desktop">Why a Desktop?</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/kadabra-cpu-usage.png"><img alt="Full system monitor on Laptop" src="../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/kadabra-cpu-usage.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">My T470 has been a little tight on resources.</div></p>

<p><a href="../../post/sold-my-bonobo/">My</a> <a href="../../post/my-t470/">laptops</a> <a href="../../post/my-new-used-x230">have</a>
served the majority of my needs these last few years, but I have been feeling
a bit restricted when trying to do more demanding workloads.
While I still side with a &ldquo;<em>use low-powered, portable computers, and remote
into more powerful ones when needed</em>&rdquo; mentality, I enjoy having <em>one</em> of those
power computers being my physical, main workstation desktop.</p>

<h2 id="workstation-goals">Workstation Goals</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/ryzen-logo.png"><img alt="Ryzen Logo" src="../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/ryzen-logo.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">My T470 has been a little tight on resources.</div></p>

<p>While building a new workstation may be fun, I have particular goals I want it
to achieve. Additionally, it seems like 98% of online build guides are for
designing <em>gaming</em> desktops&hellip; which is not exactly what I want. So, the
features I wanted in <em>my build</em>, likely deviate from much of the
<em>suggested</em> guidance found online, which tends to focus entirely on gaming
performance (more FPS). Here is the breakdown of what I was looking for:</p>

<h4 id="more-cores">More Cores</h4>

<p>I tend to have workloads that benefit from multiple cores (and threads). For
example, I run a bunch of virtual machines, often at the same time. While my
server&rsquo;s 4 core Xeon handles day to day VMs just fine, it is nice to have a
workstation with several cores to spin up a virtualized cluster across. Beyond
VMs, I compile code, compress/decompress file packages, and occasionally encode
audio/video files. These are all tasks that love having many threads at their
disposal.</p>

<h4 id="lots-of-fast-ram">Lots of (<em>fast</em>) Ram</h4>

<p>When running VMs, the amount of available RAM is usually more limiting than the
number of cpu cores. For example, when running 6 VM&rsquo;s, my server&rsquo;s 4-core Xeon
will typically be 15-35% utilized, whereas it&rsquo;s 20GB of RAM is nearly full.  If
I want more cores, I should supplement it with lots of RAM. In addition&hellip; I
use electron apps (Slack, Spotify,  etc.) and modern web browsers&hellip; so yea&hellip;. more RAM.</p>

<p>Being a Ryzen build, the RAM also needs to be <em>fast</em>.  More than other CPU
architectures, Ryzen CPUs actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0SDr3EHHmY"><em>run better</em> with faster
RAM</a>.</p>

<h4 id="fast-storage">Fast Storage</h4>

<p>This main goal of this build is for it to be a multi-tasking beast. If I am
running several VMs and a bunch of applications, utilizing a stack of <em>fast</em> RAM
to move data around&hellip; I need good <em>fast</em> storage with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh_f0uof7Jw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=359">MOAR
IOPs</a> to
support of these operations, which will all be competing for disk access. While I
wouldn&rsquo;t mind having space to eventually throw in a pair 3.5&rdquo; rust drives to configure as a
ZFS data pool, the goal for the initial <em>primary</em> drive of this
machine is the most IOPs I can <em>afford</em>. So, I ideally <em>want</em> a m.2 NVMe SSD,
but <em>need</em> a normal 2.5&rdquo; SATA SSD at the very least.</p>

<h4 id="some-gaming-ability"><em>Some</em> Gaming Ability</h4>

<p>While it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a <em>gaming machine</em>&hellip; I would like to be able to
play the <em>occasional</em> game. I don&rsquo;t mind playing games with lower graphic
settings on my laptops, but I <em>do mind</em> that even with the lower settings, the
CPUs nearly max out, which spikes up the temperature.
Increased graphics performance would also better support <a href="../../post/new-lgud4379b/">my large
monitor</a>.  A discrete graphics card would be nice, ideally
an AMD one due to their recent work on improving their open source drivers.</p>

<h4 id="ability-to-upgrade">Ability to Upgrade</h4>

<p>Most importantly, I want this computer to be a solid <em>base</em> that I can upgrade
over the next several years. Upgradability is hands-down <em>the main</em> advantage
of switching to a desktop over a laptop for my main rig. I want this build
designed so that as my needs grow, I can easily max out the RAM, add storage,
or upgrade the CPU and/or GPU.</p>

<h2 id="final-build-selections">Final Build Selections</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/charmeleon.png"><img alt="Chameleon Picture" src="../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/charmeleon.png" style="max-width: 40%; float: right;"/></a></p>

<p>After spending weeks researching all the parts on the market and building
probably 50 theoretical builds, I eventually settled on <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/himmelwr/saved/#view=MhbcYJ">my final part list</a>.</p>

<h4 id="name-charmeleon">Name: Charmeleon</h4>

<p>Since my last desktop build was named &ldquo;Charmander&rdquo;, I figured &ldquo;Charmeleon&rdquo; was
fitting. Also, I&rsquo;m then free to rename it to &ldquo;Charzard&rdquo; in the future if I <em>evolve</em>
the build to a next-generation Ryzen 7&hellip;</p>

<h4 id="cpu-ryzen-5-2600-https-en-wikichip-org-wiki-amd-ryzen-5-2600">CPU: <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/ryzen_5/2600">Ryzen 5 2600</a></h4>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/ryzen2600.jpg"><img alt="ryzen 2600" src="../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/ryzen2600.jpg" style="max-width: 40%; float: left;"/></a></p>

<p>While I initially wanted a Ryzen 2700, it pushed the build out of budget.
Coming from a 4 core/4 thread system&hellip; it&rsquo;s likely that I don&rsquo;t <em>need</em> 8
cores/16 threads right off the bat. Honestly, 4 cores/8 threads would be a
noticeable improvement from what I&rsquo;ve been using&hellip; which is why I first
considered the Ryzen 5 2400g. I planned to start with the 2400g and upgrade to
the 2700 and a GPU once I had more cash. However, <a href="https://forum.level1techs.com/t/finalizing-an-upgradable-ryzen-linux-build/134670/2">someone on the level1tech
forums</a>
reminded me that the 2600 was the same price as the 2400g, and I could get that
plus a GPU for not much more cost (considering I don&rsquo;t need an expensive GPU).
After thinking it over, I realized that was my best option, and should
<em>actually</em> fit my needs for quite awhile.</p>

<h4 id="motherboard-msi-b450-tomahawk-https-www-msi-com-motherboard-b450-tomahawk">Motherboard: <a href="https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/B450-TOMAHAWK">MSI B450 Tomahawk</a></h4>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/tomahawk.jpg"><img alt="B450 Tomahawk motherboard" src="../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/tomahawk.jpg" style="max-width: 40%; float: right;"/></a></p>

<p>I had selected the MSI B450 Tomahawk after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxtrHDJUMt4">Wendell reviewed
it</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWGzmbbimPw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=145">Several
other</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMJoLyrWa7E&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1260">reviews
confirmed</a> that it was a solid board, especially for the price. When I was
considering the 2400g, I had to switch to the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813144188">MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon
AC</a>, because
the Tomahawk didn&rsquo;t have a display output that the integrated graphics could
properly use with <a href="../../post/new-lgud4379b/">my UHD monitor</a>&rsquo;s resolution (I need a
display port). When I switched to the 2600, I was able to go back to the
TOMAHAWK, and funnel the cost savings towards getting my GPU.</p>

<h4 id="gpu-sapphire-1024-4gb-pulse-radeon-rx-560-http-www-sapphiretech-com-productdetial-asp-pid-3ecead87-2972-477a-a3be-480194d9fd6e-lang-eng">GPU: <a href="http://www.sapphiretech.com/productdetial.asp?pid=3ECEAD87-2972-477A-A3BE-480194D9FD6E&amp;lang=eng">Sapphire 1024 4GB PULSE Radeon RX 560</a></h4>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/rx560.png"><img alt="The KDE Plasma 5 extend display GUI" src="../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/rx560.png" style="max-width: 35%; float: left;"/></a></p>

<p>As discussed above, I don&rsquo;t need a killer GPU as I don&rsquo;t play very demanding
games. However, I did want something that could perform at least a <em>little
bit</em>. So, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=237L9UGQtGk&amp;t=422s">I picked the rx560 over the
rx550</a>. At first I planned
to get something like a rx580, which I still might eventually do&hellip; but
I don&rsquo;t think I will <em>need</em> to for a long time.</p>

<h4 id="ram-g-skill-trident-z-32gb-2-x-16gb-ddr4-3200mhz-ram">RAM: G.Skill - Trident Z 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4-3200Mhz RAM</h4>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/ram.png"><img alt="The KDE Plasma 5 extend display GUI" src="../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/ram.png" style="max-width: 40%; float: right;"/></a></p>

<p>I wanted to start out with 32GB of RAM, with the ability to easily upgrade to
64GB down the road. This meant that I needed a 2x16GB pack. Additionally, I
needed the RAM to be <em>fast</em>, but still not <em>overpriced</em>. Some research showed
that at least right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/lxtrHDJUMt4?t=752">3200Mhz seems to be the sweet spot, especially for my
particular motherboard</a>. I originally
picked another kit, but the reviews for it weren&rsquo;t great, so I switched to the
G.Skill kit for only a few dollars more, but with much better reviews. I also
briefly searched for kits with tighter timings, but they were <em>way</em> more expensive and not worth it.</p>

<h4 id="case-fractal-design-meshify-c-dark-tg-atx-mid-tower-https-www-fractal-design-com-home-product-cases-meshify-meshify-c">Case: <a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/home/product/cases/meshify/meshify-c">Fractal Design - Meshify C Dark TG ATX Mid Tower</a></h4>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/meshifyc.png"><img alt="The KDE Plasma 5 extend display GUI" src="../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/meshifyc.png" style="max-width: 30%; float: left; margin-bottom: 10px;"/></a></p>

<p>I wanted a case that was sturdy, sleek, but not too flashy or expensive. During my
search, the Fractal Design cases kept catching eye. Eventually, I found the
Meshify C TG Dark, which seemed to be universally loved by reviewers. Additionally,
it appeared to have <a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/home/product/cases/meshify/meshify-c">good
thermals</a>,
which I liked. This was my easiest part to pick.</p>

<h4 id="psu-evga-supernova-g4-650w-80-gold-fully-modular-atx-psu-https-web-archive-org-web-20181102223931-https-www-evga-com-products-product-aspx-pn-120-g1-0650-xr">PSU: EVGA - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181102223931/https://www.evga.com/Products/Product.aspx?pn=120-G1-0650-XR">SuperNOVA G4 650W 80+ Gold, fully modular ATX PSU</a></h4>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/psu.png"><img alt="The KDE Plasma 5 extend display GUI" src="../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/psu.png" style="max-width: 35%; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px;"/></a></p>

<p>For the power supply, I wanted one that was at least gold rated, and fully
modular. So I searched for the highest rated PSUs fitting those requirements&hellip;
and SuperNova popped up all over the place. At first I picked a 550w model, but
upped to the 650w at the last minute because it was about the same price and
gives me a little more room as I upgrade.</p>

<h4 id="storage-one-of-my-samsung-850-evo-ssds-temp">Storage: One of my Samsung 850 Evo SSDs (temp)</h4>

<p>Lastly, storage. For now I am just going to use a spare 250GB Samsung 850 Evo SSD
I had in my test laptop. I plan to eventually upgrade to a <a href="https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/product/consumer/970evo/">500GB Samsung 970 Evo
m.2 NVMe
drive</a>,
but the 850 will work for now.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So after months of planing and research, my desktop parts have all been
ordered. Hopefully, it meets the goals I set out to solve, and I will be able
to upgrade it over the next few years</p>
