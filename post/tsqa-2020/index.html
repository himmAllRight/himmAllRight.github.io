    <article>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                    
                    <p>Several weeks ago I attend TSQA 2020, a conference presented every two years by
the <a href="https://tsqa.org">Triangle Software Quality Association</a> (TSQA). Despite
being hosted by my local software testing group, the speakers and
attendees were from all over the country. While only a single-day conference,
it was packed full with solid advice and ideas I left with. Here are a few.</p>

<p><em>Just to clarify: TSQA occured in February, right before COVID-19 really started spreading
in the US. I&rsquo;m just very late in this post.</em></p>

<h2 id="tsqa-2020">TSQA 2020</h2>

<h4 id="getting-there">Getting There</h4>

<p>TSQA was held at the <a href="https://www.durhamconventioncenter.com">Durham Convention
Center</a>, which is located in the middle
of downtown Durham (NC, USA). Being so close to our office, I managed to help
convince/remind several of my co-workers to register last minute. On the
morning of the event, I drove the one mile to the office parking garage, then
hustled coat-less through the cold morning wind to the conference center.</p>

<p>As I walked inside, I immediately saw my manager at the entrance handing out
bandages, and knew I was in the right place (he was a TSQA volunteer).  After
saying hello and checking in, I made my way to the main ballroom to grab some
food. After awhile, my co-workers started to trickle in, so we found a table
near the front and gathered for the opening statements.</p>

<h4 id="keynote">Keynote</h4>

<div class="caption">The Jetsons</div>
</center></p>

<p>They keynote, presented by <a href="http://angiejones.tech">Angie Jones</a> was an
entertaining look at the history and future of technology. She took ideas that
were shown in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jetsons">The Jetsons</a>, and
compared them to how close (or far) we have come to many of them. She then used
this as an example of how we should be planning to test <em>future</em> technology,
because like it or not, it&rsquo;s coming. She concluded by providing some examples
of what testing in the future could look like.</p>

<h4 id="talks">Talks</h4>

<p>For the rest of the day, I attended several talks interspaced with a lunch and
snack break. I mainly focused on attending talks around automation, but also
went to a few about developing test cases or UI testing tools. Similar to my
<a href="../../post/ato2019/">All Things Open 2019 post</a>, instead of narrating each talk I
went to, I picked out few lessons I learned and will share them below.</p>

<p>After the conference ended, my co-workers and I made our way back to the office
to share experiences and debate our thoughts over a drink.  It&rsquo;s always great
to hash out ideas with others after a conference, while they are still fresh.
Also&hellip; it&rsquo;s fun :) .</p>

<h3 id="lessons-learned-strengthened">Lessons Learned/Strengthened</h3>

<p>Now to summarize a few of the many lessons I picked up while at TSQA 2020. I&rsquo;ve
heard many of these suggestions before, but the speakers presented them so
well, I really want to ensure I start implementing the at work.  Lets get
started.</p>

<h4 id="no-failing-tests">No failing tests</h4>

<p>It is all too easy to let a backlog of failing tests build up. This may be
due to the test being out of date, a low priority issue, or worse of
all&hellip; just a flaky test. Regardless of the reason, failing tests really should
be mitigated <em>immediately</em>, for several reasons.</p>

<p>Leaving failing tests to continuously run causes failure fatigue. This
normalizes the failing tests and causes a team to ignore <em>other</em> failing tests in
the future. Basically, it decreases the competence in the test suite, and thus
the QE team as a whole.</p>

<p><center>
<a href="../../img/posts/tsqa-2020/disable-tests-meme.jpg">
<img alt="Failing tests meme" src="../../img/posts/tsqa-2020/disable-tests-meme.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px"/></a>
<div class="caption">This is supposed to be a joke, but it&rsquo;s actually
the point I&rsquo;m sharing. If tests are failing, disable or get rid of them, <em>AFTER</em> filing an
issue! </div>
</center></p>

<p>So, if a project has continuously failing tests, try to fix them as quick
as possible. If there currently isn&rsquo;t time to fix it (we&rsquo;ve all been there),
that&rsquo;s fine, but file an issue to <em>remember</em> to fix it later. Then disable it.
It will make a test suite more meaningful, because each failure
<em>means something important</em>.</p>

<p>One last statement here: <strong>No</strong> flaky tests either. If we can&rsquo;t depend on them,
they aren&rsquo;t worth having.  Either figure out how to fix them so they are
consistent, or remove them.</p>

<h4 id="write-tests-to-pass-for-known-issues">Write tests to pass for known issues</h4>

<p>Now, lets expand that suggestion of disabling failing tests, and write tests
that <em>pass</em> when a <em>known</em> defect happens. While sounding counter-intuitive at
first, this idea makes more sense if you accept the fact that tests don&rsquo;t
actually <em>find</em> defects. Rather, automated tests depict the <em>state</em> of a
system, and fail when <em>something has changed</em>. A passed or failed test simply
acts as a <em>data point</em>. When a quality engineer goes and investigates the test
results, <em>they</em> determine if there is a defect based on the data.</p>

<p>For example, lets assume I have a test that asserts that an api call returns a
<code>200</code> status. However, due to a known issue, it is currently returning <code>404</code>s.
I <em>know</em> that in its current state, the system returns a <code>404</code> for that api
call, so I can change/add a test to assert that it is indeed, returning <code>404</code>s.
This technique <em>removes a failing test</em> (as suggest in the previous section),
while allowing us to maintain that data point. The test will pass while it
continues to return <code>404</code>&rsquo;s, but will fail and notify us of any related state
changes.</p>

<p>Those changes could be from the developers merging a bug fix&hellip; or a
<em>new</em> defect popping up, resulting in the api call now returning <code>500</code> errors.
Regardless, we know that something has changed again, and we should investigate. By
comparison, an always-failing or fully removed test would not have demanded our
attention so easily.</p>

<h4 id="better-documentation">Better Documentation</h4>

<p>So&hellip; if we have our tests setup to <em>pass</em> for known defects, lets make one
thing clear&hellip; we need to make sure we have <strong>amazing documentation</strong>. This is
imperative.</p>

<p><center>
<a href="../../img/posts/tsqa-2020/documentation-meme.png">
<img alt="Documentation Meme" src="../../img/posts/tsqa-2020/documentation-meme.png" style="max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px"/></a>
</center></p>

<p>Any test designed to pass on a known defect should contain a few pieces of
information in its documentation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Why the test is there</em>: If a test is checking for undesired
behavior, it is a good idea to quickly document something along the lines
of &lsquo;This test is checking for behavior we don&rsquo;t want. It is just here
until an issue is fixed&rsquo;.</p></li>

<li><p><em>The issue number</em>. If a test exists until a known issue is resolved&hellip;
please include the issue/bug number in the documentation. This will make it
much easier for others (or you!) to find more information, or check if the
issue is already closed once the test starts failing (due to a fix).</p></li>

<li><p><em>What we expect from the test</em>: Try to document why the test is
currently passing, and what we expect when it starts failing again.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Continuing with our example from above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This test has been altered until issue #23483 is resolved. Currently, this api
call returns a 404 status. If the issue is resolved, it should return a 200
status, at which point this test needs to be updated.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lastly, remember to periodically clean up the documentation.  When filing an
issue, state <em>were</em> a failing test can be found if it is being updated to match
the behavior. This way when the issue is closed, it will be easier to go update
the test. Temporary test states can also be marked with a tag, such as <code>TODO</code>
to make them easier to search through.  Honestly, whatever works for your team.
The goal is to create enough context so that someone else is able to know what
is going on and fix it without having to find you.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, TSQA 2020 turned out to be a wonderful conference and was a desirable
size. It was not crazy and over-crowded, but also not so small that it felt
awkward.  It had a diverse mix of people from all over the country, and the
highest percentage of women I have ever seen at a tech conference. I had a
great time and definitely plan to attend the next one&hellip;  even if I have to
travel more than a mile next time.</p>
