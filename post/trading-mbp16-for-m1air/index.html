                    <p>Over a year has passed since I purchased a <a href="../../post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/">base model 2019 16&rdquo; MacBook
Pro</a>. My first Mac. With it&rsquo;s large &ldquo;retina&rdquo;
display, resurrected magic keyboard, and truly <em>amazing</em> speakers, it might
be the most pleasurable laptop I have ever owned. However, I decided to trade
it in&hellip; for a new MacBook <em>air</em>. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mac_challenge.jpeg"><img alt="Installing macOS Cataline on old air" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mac_challenge.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Installing macOS Catalina on my wife&rsquo;s old MacBook Air for my Mac challenge</div></p>

<p>In the Fall of 2019, I decided to do a <a href="../../post/macos-challenge/">30 day macOS</a>
challenge. During the challenge, I learned that while I think Linux is still
my go-to and <em>indispensable</em> OS, I did enjoy having a mac available for doing
more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKiAnxjM8Nc">&ldquo;normal life computing&rdquo;</a>.
Web browsing, writing emails, managing calendars, personal finance, planning
home projects with my wife, ssh&rsquo;ing into servers to code&hellip; that type of
stuff.</p>

<p>After the challenge, I decided to acquire a mac for myself. I choose the 16&rdquo;
MBP <em>mostly</em> because it was the only MacBook at the time with the new magic
keyboard. That was a hard requirement I had. I wouldn&rsquo;t even consider buying
a butterfly MacBook. Keyboard aside, as my <em>only</em> Mac, I did want it
to be powerful enough to be my &lsquo;workstation&rsquo; mac/laptop. And it was.</p>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_cooling.png"><img alt="the mbp had better cooling" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_cooling.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">While the 16&rdquo; MacBook Pro did improve cooling compared to it&rsquo;s predecessor, it was still too warm for my tastes</div></p>

<p>After a few months of use, a problem emerged regarding that power&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t utilize it. As I discovered
<a href="../../post/sold-my-bonobo/">the last time I had a more &ldquo;workstation laptop&rdquo;</a>, I
don&rsquo;t like when my computers overheat and spin up their fans. The 16&rdquo; macbook
was relatively thin for its specs (did you see the size of
my previous workstaion laptop!?!?). However, that sleek design came at a
cost. While the re-designed cooling on the 16&rdquo; was considered quite good for
a MacBook&hellip; it didn&rsquo;t meet my standards.</p>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_photoimport_turboboost.png"><img alt="Importing photos, turbo boost made temps 100c" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_photoimport_turboboost.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">While using the CPU (importing photos), the temps stayed at 80C with turbo boost disabled. After enabling it, the temps shot up to 100C!</div></p>

<p>I eventually purchased and installed <a href="http://tbswitcher.rugarciap.com">turbo boost
switcher</a>, to <em>disable turbo boost on my
cpu</em> This runs the cpu at it&rsquo;s base clock, without boosting it up for more
&lsquo;bursty&rsquo; performance. This didn&rsquo;t seem to hinder my small day-to-day usage,
and in my mind, was more than worth the trade to keep the computer a little
bit cooler, and prevent the fans from spinning up all the time. It was just a
shame to pay so much money for such powerful computer&hellip; and then
purposefully hinder it.</p>

<h2 id="the-m1-macs-are-released">The M1 Macs are Released</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/m1_released.png"><img alt="Apple's M1 Announcement" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/m1_released.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Apple announced it&rsquo;s first Apple Silicon CPU, the M1</div></p>

<p>Then, in November, Apple announced the new M1 Macs, the first
computers in the company&rsquo;s planned 2 transition to switch from Intel CPUs to
Apple&rsquo;s own &ldquo;Apple Silicon&rdquo; arm processors. And they were a hit.</p>

<p>While I was skeptical about the smoothness of a cpu architecture switch, early
reviewers indicated that Apple handled it extremely well. This had me
tempted to immediately swap my MBP in for one of the newer ones. But, I decided to
hold out for a bit, reasoning that my 16&rdquo; computer was still an <em>amazing</em>
laptop that was more than capable of what I needed it for.</p>

<p>Still, the seed of questioning <em>how</em> I use a mac had been planted.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-use-a-mac">How I use a Mac</h2>

<p>I started to map out my Mac use-cases in two broad categories: <em>What</em> I
use my mac for, and <em>where</em> I use it. After some brainstorming, I had the
following lists:</p>

<h4 id="what-i-use-a-mac-for"><em>What</em> I use a Mac For</h4>

<p>I most commonly use my Mac for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Utilizing Apple apps and services (Messages, FaceTime, Notes, Reminders,
Photos, GarageBand, Music, iCloud, Etc)</li>
<li>Web Browsing</li>
<li>Online Courses/Proctored Exams</li>
<li>SSH and/or VS Code (I do coding, writing, and all those other tasks on my workstation, and remote in when on my MacBook)</li>
<li>Personal Planning/organizing, emails</li>
<li>Listen to podcasts or music</li>
<li>Watching videos or livestreams</li>
<li>Chatting with Friends and Family</li>
<li><em>Maybe</em> a light game if I&rsquo;m on the go or not at my desk (possibly streamed from my gaming VM)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="where-i-use-a-macbook"><em>Where</em> I use a MacBook</h4>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/macbook_stand.jpeg"><img alt="Macbook on a stand" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/macbook_stand.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">As my main laptop, my MacBook occasionally has to serve as my portable workstation</div></p>

<p>Being both my <em>only</em> Mac, as well as my main portable computer, there is
actually quite a range of <em>where</em> and <em>how</em> I setup my MacBook. Some examples
include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Portable: I use it as my portable machine, in a few types of locations:

<ul>
<li>Sitting on the couch</li>
<li>At a Table, by itself</li>
<li>At a table on a stand w/ Keyboard, and possibly other external displays</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As my single portable workstation if I travel or visit family</li>
<li>As my Mac &lsquo;desktop&rsquo;, connected to all the devices at my desk via a thunderbolt hub.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="best-tool-for-the-job">Best Tool for the Job</h3>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/desktop_benchmarking.jpeg"><img alt="Using my macbook while running benchmarks on my desktop" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/desktop_benchmarking.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Using my MBP while running benchmarks on my desktop
after <u><a href="../../post/selecting-charmeleons-upgrades/">some upgrades</a></u>. Dispite
its pwer, my Mac is a <em>secondary</em> computer.</div></p>

<p>A disparity stood out to me while makings these lists. I
generally try to use appropriate hardware for my need (at least within
reason). Looking over what I wrote, it felt weird to have a $2000+ laptop for
what I use it for. I did <em>not</em> need that much for my <em>secondary computer</em>,
even if I loved the speakers and screen.</p>

<p>If this was my <em>main</em> computer, it would be fine. But it isn&rsquo;t. I have a
<a href="../../post/selecting-charmeleons-upgrades/">powerful linux workstation</a> for my
heavy lifting and complicated, virtual workloads. Hell, macOS isn&rsquo;t even my
main OS. I do all my power-user computing on Linux&hellip; even if it&rsquo;s <em>from</em> my
mac (as previously stated, I <code>ssh</code> into my desktop for nearly everything&hellip;
including writing these posts). The MBP <em>met</em> the role I needed it for, but
it didn&rsquo;t necessarily
<em>fit</em> that role.</p>

<h3 id="16-mbp-vs-air">16&rdquo; MBP vs. Air</h3>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/both_macs_closed.jpeg"><img alt="Both Macs, closed on table" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/both_macs_closed.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The 2019 16&rdquo; MacBook Pro and the 2020 M1 Macbook Air</div></p>

<p>After hammering out my MacBook use cases, I theorized how a M1 MacBook Air
might compare to my 16&rdquo; MBP in meeting those needs. I came up with the following
conclusions:</p>

<ul>
<li>While I do occasionally use some of the mac&rsquo;s heavier software (garageband,
imovie, Photos, and others), the performance of the M1 is more than enough
for what I would need it to do, and even <em>beats</em> my Intel MBP on some tasks.</li>
<li>It wouldn&rsquo;t benefit me to wait for more powerful Apple Silicon Macs,
as my needs are already passed for what I need this device to do. Even
if an Apple Silicon 16&rdquo; MBP <em>was</em> available, tempting as it might be, I&rsquo;ve
already established it isn&rsquo;t a good fit for this device.</li>
<li>While I would miss the screen space and speakers, the air would be <em>much</em>
more portable. Not only would this be great when traveling, but it would also
be appreciated when picking it up with one hand to take into another room.</li>
<li>The dedicated GPU in the MBP doesn&rsquo;t really benefit me, as I do all my
gaming in a Windows VM on my workstation. In fact, it may actually <em>hurt</em> my
experience by generating excess heat and kicking up the fans.</li>
<li>And on that note&hellip; the air doesn&rsquo;t even <em>have</em> a fan to spin up, and
doesn&rsquo;t appear to get too warm either. Unlike the M1 MBP, it <em>will</em> throttle
to cool the CPU during sustained workloads, but we&rsquo;ve already established
that I am <em>currently</em> doing that on my 16&rdquo; anyway ☺︎.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I concluded that the Air should be able to do most of the tasks my
16&rdquo; MBP does, at around the same level of perfomrance, if not better. In the
case of portability and noise, the air would be <strong>much</strong> better suited than
my Pro. Additionally, most of the workloads the MBP <em>is</em> better at,
aren&rsquo;t as important for my needs.</p>

<h2 id="decided-to-go-for-it">Decided to Go for it</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/trade-in-value.png"><img alt="Current trade-in-value" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/trade-in-value.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">I knew my trade-in value would only get worse, and I didn&rsquo;t need to wait for the new 16&rdquo; Pro to come out</div></p>

<p>Eventually, I decided to make the trade-in. My main reasons were:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The current trade-in price would cover the cost of the &ldquo;higher end&rdquo; M1
Macbook Air, and I would only have to pay tax and for any other updgrades I
wanted to make.</p></li>

<li><p>I knew I would slowly get less and less for my MBP. I figured once a new
16&rdquo; MBP was released, the value for mine would likely plummet.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, I ordered the higher tier Air ( with 8gpu cores + 512GB of storage),
and bumped up the RAM to 16GB. If I was going to be be &ldquo;downgrading&rdquo;
from a MBP to an Air, I wanted to at least keep the same amount of RAM and
storage that I had before. It took almost a month to arrive, but now it&rsquo;s
here, and I&rsquo;m packing up the MBP to send back.</p>

<p>I need this secondary computer to function as my portable laptop, and only
(physical) Mac. I think the m1 air will fill both of these roles extremely
well. If I needed a laptop to be my <em>main</em> machine&hellip; I would have probably
kept the MBP and upgrade after a newer Apple Silicon version is released.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp16.jpeg"><img alt="My mbp." src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp16.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">My old 16&rdquo; MacBook Pro</div></p>

<p>The 2019 16&rdquo; MacBook Pro was, and still is, an amazing machine. I <em>will</em> miss
it. Ultimately though, a combination of the M1 Macs being <em>very</em> good, and
the fact that a smaller, thin and light laptop fit my use case best,
finalized my decision to switch.</p>
