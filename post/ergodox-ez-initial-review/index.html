                    <p>Several weeks ago, I wrote about how I <a href="../../post/decided-to-get-an-ergodox/">decided to purchase an
ergodox-ez</a> split keyboard. In that
post, I omitted any details about what configuration I ordered,
as well my impressions about the board. Now that I have been an
ergodox owner for&hellip; wow, over two months&hellip; I guess this post is
due. Here are my &lsquo;<em>initial</em>&rsquo; thoughts of the ergodox-ez&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="ordering-and-shipping">Ordering and shipping</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/both_boxes.jpeg"><img alt="The Boxes my ergdox came in" src="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/both_boxes.jpeg" style="max-width:
100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The boxes the ergodox-ez shipped in</div></p>

<p>So, what ergodox did I order? After a few hours toggling the
configuration tool and endless internal debating, I eventually settled on an
ergodox-ez <em>glow</em> (backlit keys), with a black body, and black printed, LED
compatible, key caps.  With a narrowed selection of switch options (to maintain
backlit key compatibility), I landed on Cherry MX Browns as my best choice. I
wanted a noticeable tactile bump, but didn&rsquo;t want &ldquo;click-y&rdquo; keys. I prefer a
lower &ldquo;<em>Clack</em>&rdquo;, while typing and find the higher pitch of MX Blues annoying.
I decided that I might as well go all in with this keyboard, so I ordered the
tenting poles and black wrist rests as well.</p>

<p>With everything decided, I placed my order and prepared myself to wait
in anticipated glee for&hellip; an average of 3 weeks shipping time ಠ_ಠ. <em>Luckily</em>,
I was fortunate and about a week later, I had a large, flat box show up at my
door!</p>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_box_plastic.jpeg"><img alt="Opened the ergodox box" src="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_box_plastic.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Opening the main box</div></p>

<p>Everything was very well packaged. The keyboard came in one box, and the wrist
rests had their own. The two boxes had the same width, so they could be shipped
as one unit. Lifting the lid on the larger box, I was greeted by the keyboard
looking back at me through a plastic panel, with it&rsquo;s accessories (cables, key
switch puller, screws) neatly pinned around it.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>The initial <em>physical</em> setup was quite simple. I took everything out of the
box, connected the two halves of the board together with the included TRRS
cable, and then used the mini usb cable (also included) to connect right half
of the board to my laptop&rsquo;s usb port. I positioned the wrist-rests and tweaked
the tenting poles to some arbitrary position, acting as if I knew what I was
doing.  That was it. After that point, I was able to type&hellip; <em>stuff</em>&hellip; into my
computer.</p>

<h3 id="initial-layout-changes">Initial Layout Changes</h3>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_defalut_layout.png"><img alt="The ergodox default layout" src="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_default_layout.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The default ergodox layout</div></p>

<p>I say <em>stuff</em>, because I wasn&rsquo;t able to just pick up the board
and feel 100% comfortable like one might with a &ldquo;normal&rdquo;
keyboard. There was definitely a learning curve (more on that later).  However,
the main problem was that I didn&rsquo;t even know the <em>default layout</em>. The
back-lit QWERTY keys were labeled, but all of the modifier keys on the sides
and in the thumb clusters were not. So, I navigated online to the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/oryx">oryx
configurator</a> with two goals in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>To learn the standard layout that the board shipped with, and</li>
<li>To alter some of the defaults with changes I <em>knew</em> I would want (caps lock as a ctrl, for example)</li>
</ul>

<p>After a few minutes of scanning and tweaking, I had my first layout to flash.
I downloaded the file&hellip; and ran into my only <em>true</em> issue I&rsquo;ve experienced with the
ergodox&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="issues-with-wally">Issues with Wally</h3>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_macbook.jpeg"><img alt="Using the ergodox with my Macbook Pro" src="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_macbook.jpeg" style="max-width:
100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Using the ergodox-ez with my MacBook Pro</div></p>

<p>While I was able to flash the firmware using my macbook, for some reason my
Fedora laptops and desktop had issues at first. I would open up
<a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/wally">wally</a> (ZSA&rsquo;s firmware flashing tool), load the
firmware file, and press the tiny &lsquo;reset&rsquo; button on my keyboard with a
paper-clip&hellip; and it would freeze. The back lights stopped their colorful
dancing and key presses rendered no response. The only way
to get the board to respond again was to unplug and replug it back in.</p>

<p>I had heard that ZSA had good customer support, so I emailed them about my problem.
They responded right away and helped to debug what might be happening.  It
appeared to be some sort of permissions issue, although to this day I&rsquo;m not
100% sure what it actually was. Eventually, it started working. Since then I
have updated most of my computers to Fedora 33, and I use a newer version of
Wally. I haven&rsquo;t had trouble since, even on fresh OS installs. It just works.</p>

<p>Oh well, problem resolved I guess? My main takeaways from the experience were
that 1) wally definitely requires <code>sudo</code> root permissions, and 2) that ZSA&rsquo;s customer
support is wonderful.  Oh, and <a href="https://github.com/zsa/wally">open source
firmware</a> is the best, but I already knew that.</p>

<p>(Note: ZSA has since updated the Linux README instructions to contain the udev
instructions they gave me)</p>

<h2 id="getting-used-to-and-learning-the-board">Getting used to and learning the board</h2>

<p>As previously stated, I knew I would have to put some effort into learning how
to type on the ergodox. When I got it, I did a fair bit of
<a href="https://www.keybr.com">typing</a> <a href="https://play.typeracer.com/">practice</a> and
used it for work everyday. Within a few days, I was at a passable typing speed,
and after a few more, and I reached a <em>decent</em> speed. I am not sure if I am any
<em>faster</em> than on my old keyboard, but I can type fast for much longer (I
could only burst speed-type on the HHKB before starting to cramp up, mostly due to
poor form).</p>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/oryx_trainer.png"><img alt="Oryx Training Tool" src="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/oryx_trainer.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The Oryx Training Tool</div></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t done any typing practice the last few weeks and I&rsquo;ve started to
notice <em>some</em> of my bad habits creeping back in. I want to start up
again and might try to use the trainer that is included in the Oryx tool. It is
able to connect to the keyboard to show your layout, and provides several types
of content to type through (code, books, symbols). I might use it to
help determine an optimized coding layer places my most used symbols in easy to
reach places.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-like">What I like</h2>

<h3 id="customizability">Customizability</h3>

<p>This board is fully customizable on both the hardware <em>and</em> software side.</p>

<h4 id="firmware">Firmware</h4>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_layout.png"><img alt="Ergodox layout" src="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_layout.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">One of my custom layer layouts</div></p>

<p>Being able to tweak the layout of multiple layers means there are an endless
amount of ways I can tailor my keyboard to fit my needs. My tweaking has
slowed down a bit, but I love that I can make quick changes to my layout if I
decide there is a better way to do something. For example, today I realized I wanted to add
a key on one of my alternate layers, so I popped open oryx and wally, and had
the change finished in about a minute.</p>

<p>Having an open firmware keyboard is reminiscent of when I <a href="http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/back-on-arch/">used vanilla arch
linux</a>. I would go weeks
assuming I had everything required for a typical desktop environment, when all
of sudden, I would try to open a pdf and realize I never installed a pdf
reader&hellip; or a <em>file browser</em>. Last week while working, I noticed that
my ergodox layout didn&rsquo;t have a &lsquo;delete&rsquo; key. So I quickly added one. Done.</p>

<p>(Note: Be aware that I haven&rsquo;t even touched on the advanced layout options,
like macros and long vs short key presses)</p>

<h4 id="hardware">Hardware</h4>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/key_switches.jpeg"><img alt="Key switches" src="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/key_switches.jpeg" style="max-width:
100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Testing swapping out a switch with one from my switch
tester</div></p>

<p>In addition to the firmware, It&rsquo;s nice to know that there is quite a bit I can
    <em>physically</em> change about my keyboard. Specifically, the key caps can be
    changed and the switches themselves are hot-swappable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already looked around for some of the parts I could swap out on my board
in a few years if I want to mix things up. For example, I am interesting in
swapping to mx clear switches someday. The problem with clears is the lights
would not (ironically) shine through anymore. I guess that wouldn&rsquo;t be too big
of an issue though, because many of the alternative key caps I like are opaque
ツ.</p>

<p><em>Anyway</em>&hellip; Despite talking about all the hardware upgrades I <em>could</em> make, I
actually do enjoy it&rsquo;s current configuration. But I do love that I have the
option to change it over time.</p>

<h3 id="ortholinear">Ortholinear</h3>

<p>While it was more difficult to get used to than I expected, I have found using
an orthlinear layout to be considerably easier to type on. My fingers no longer
fight and trip over each other like Black-Friday shoppers trying to grab the
last hot-ticket item. The <em>worst</em> thing about using an ortholinear layout is
that I now want it to become a standard option when buying laptops: ISO or ANSI,
Ortho or Staggard? Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t see that happening anytime soon&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="split-design">Split Design</h3>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/laptop_stand.jpeg"><img alt="Ergodox around a laptop stand" src="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/laptop_stand.jpeg" style="max-width:
100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">A split design keyboard pairs nicely with a laptop stand.</div></p>

<p>Like the ortholinear layout, a fully split keyboard is a considerable
ergonomic boost.  I can lay my arms on the desk in whichever way is most
comfortable&hellip; and then position the keyboard to match <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>As a bonus, the split design pairs nicely with laptop stands, allowing me to
slide the stand closer. This makes it easier to view smaller screens at a
proper height.</p>

<h3 id="thumb-cluster-keys">Thumb cluster keys</h3>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_wood.jpeg"><img alt="ergodox on wood desk" src="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_wood.jpeg" style="max-width:
100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The thumb cluster of keys has allowed me to better utilize my thumbs, which has been a nice change</div></p>

<p>Another feature I immediately miss on other keyboards, is thumb keys. It is a
relief to provide my thumbs control over more keys than just the spacebar. The
thumb clusters enable me to offload responsibility for backspace, tab, enter,
delete, and a few other keys from my weakest fingers (pinkies), to my strongest
(thumbs). This makes a huge difference while typing, but is probably the
biggest difficulty I have when switching to a laptop keyboard from my ergodox.
I keep finding myself smashing the spacebar when trying to backspace or enter.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-don-t-love">What I don&rsquo;t love</h2>

<p>Honestly, there is not much that I don&rsquo;t <em>like</em> about the ergodox-ez. That
being said, if forced to be picky, here is a thing or two that I don&rsquo;t <em>love</em>
about it&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="learning-curve">Learning curve</h3>

<p><center>
<a href="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/typing_test.png"><img alt="typing test results" src="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/typing_test.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Results from one of my typing practices</div>
</center></p>

<p>The biggest con to getting a keyboard like the ergodox is the learning curve.
It isn&rsquo;t something that you will be able to pick up and immediately start
using.  It will require time and deliberate daily practice to really start to
feel comfortable. If you know this when purchasing, it isn&rsquo;t that big of a
problem, but can be extremely frustrating at first.</p>

<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>

<p>It is expensive. Especially for a unique board that you might end up hating.
With that said, if the ergodox works for you, the cost isn&rsquo;t as bad as it might
initially appear.  The ergodox-ez is a solid board, with the
ability to customize both it&rsquo;s hardware and firmware over a span of many years.
On top of that, when compared to <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/products/#advantage2">other &lsquo;ergonomic&rsquo; split
keyboards</a>, the ergodox is
priced rather fairly.</p>

<h3 id="it-s-difficult-to-switch-back-to-my-hhkb">It&rsquo;s difficult to switch back to my HHKB&hellip;</h3>

<p>Switching to keyboards on my laptops is mostly fine, but for whatever
reason &hellip; I can&rsquo;t type on my HHKB. It feels so squished, and I can&rsquo;t seem to
naturally position my fingers on the correct keys anymore. I&rsquo;m sure if I
dedicate a few hours to using the HHKB this might go away, but I haven&rsquo;t done
that yet.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_office.jpeg"><img alt="The ergodox in my home office" src="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_office.jpeg" style="max-width:
100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The ergodox-ez in my home office</div></p>

<p>Overall, I love this keyboard and am very satisfied with my choice. Now that I am used
to it, it feels normal to type on and I don&rsquo;t have to think about it.
The Split design and ortholinear layout make it the most natural feeling
and comfortable board I have used. As a bonus, any layout issues can be stomped
out with a 2 minute config change and flash, ensuring that I should <em>continue</em>
to love this board even as my preferences change. As long as you are aware of
what you are getting into, I highly recommend the ergodox-ez.</p>
