                    <p>After years of using a Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite, I have <em>finally</em> decided to splurge on a Happy Hacking Professional 2 keyboard. And I love it.</p>

<p></p>

<p><em>Note: I have been slowly chipping away at this post for the last few months. I have been very busy, but I should be able to get back into the swing of writing again.</em></p>

<h2 id="my-history-with-the-hhkb-lite">My history with the HHKB Lite</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/college-computer.jpg"><img alt="Getting the HHKB Keyboard" src="../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/college-computer.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div id="caption">My Computer (HHKB lite included) during my senior year of college</div></p>

<p>I started using Linux during my senior year of high school. In college, I started diving deeper down the rabbit hole, learning more about shells, window managers, and programming. By senior year, I found myself sitting in front of an <a href="http://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> install, configured with a tiling window manger to organize the scattering of VIM and VIM-like terminal applications I used every day. To be kind to my wrists, I wanted something that was optimized at the hardware level for my heavy <em>CTRL</em> key use. This is when I first learned about the HHKB. However, as a broke college student, I opted for the much cheaper <em>lite</em> version to test out. I enjoyed the layout so much, that years later when I needed to replace a keyboard at work, I had them order me a HHKB lite (again, the Pro was very expensive).</p>

<h2 id="time-for-a-mechanical-keyboard">Time for a Mechanical Keyboard</h2>

<p>After years of using the standard rubber dome HHKB lite, I wanted to finally switch to a true mechanical keyboard. I searched long and hard, looking at different layouts designs, and learning about the various switch types (mostly the commony <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_(keyboards)">cherry MX switches</a>). After purchasing and playing with a <a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=1620">switch tester</a>, I confirmed that I would likely enjoy MX clear switches best. They are quiet enough I could still reasonably use them in an office, but still had the nice tactile bump that I love (more than what I experienced on the Browns). Additionally, I knew that I wanted to stick with a small, minimalist layout, so I exclusively looked at <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/60%25">60% keyboards</a>, with the occasional <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/40%25">40%</a> board catching my eye.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8wjW-Or1jg8/maxresdefault.jpg"><img alt="The Pok3r Keyboard" src="../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/pok3r.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div id="caption">The Pok3r Keyboard</div></p>

<p>Like many, I eventually landed at the <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Vortex_Pok3r">Vortex Pok3r</a>. It is beautiful, with a minimal, but sturdy appearance, and has a MX clear variant. I had made my decision, but at the time, new boards weren&rsquo;t available. I decided to sit back and wait to see if it would drop on <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/">Massdrop</a> any time soon. I had waited years to purchase a mechanical keyboard, and I could wait a little longer to get the one I wanted.</p>

<h2 id="the-planck-drop">The Planck Drop</h2>

<p><img alt="The Planck Keyboard" src="../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/planck.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/>
<div id="caption">The Planck Keyboard</div></p>

<p>While I was waiting for a Pok3r drop&hellip; something interesting caught my eye on Massdrop&hellip; the <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/planck-mechanical-keyboard">Planck keyboard</a>&hellip; The planck is a keyboard kit that you solder together to create a programmable, <em>ortholinear</em>, 40% keyboard. When I say <em>programmable</em>, I don&rsquo;t mean that you can just bind some keys. The Planck is fully open and the firmware C code is available on Github for modification. So, you can actually customize and hack together the firmware, which was very appealing to me. So I joined the drop.</p>

<p>After joining, I purchased a soldering kit so that I could construct the keyboard once it finally shipped. Unfortunately, the planck drop had <em>several</em> delays, but as I previously stated, I didn&rsquo;t waiting. The planck got delayed <em>so</em> much, that they eventually allowed people to cancel their order and receive a refund. I thought the order cancellation was something you <em>opted in</em> to do, but it was actually an <em>opt out</em> situation&hellip; so my lack of response had my order canceled, pre-maturely ending my planck experience.</p>

<h2 id="deciding-on-the-hhkb-pro">Deciding on the HHKB Pro</h2>

<p>With my planck order canceled, and a refund imminent, I started to look at other options again. The main contender was still the Pok3r. I started researching it again and learning about how I could program the layers to have a layout I would like&hellip; and eventually realized I just kept re-creating the infamous HHKB layout.</p>

<p>So I started to consider the HHKB again. My main reasons for not getting it originally was that it is a good bit more expensive than the majority of mechanical keyboards on the market. However, after waiting months for the planck, and noticing I kept comparing everything to the HHKB, I realized I would eventually end up with an HHKB anyway, and decided to just go for it now. Decision made.</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-hhkb">Getting the HHKB</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/got-hhkb.jpg"><img alt="Getting the HHKB Keyboard" src="../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/got-hhkb.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div id="caption">My HHKB</div></p>

<p>Once I decided on the HHKB, (and it was approved by my wife :P ), I purchased it on Amazon. The one thing I did contemplate about was which color to get. I didn&rsquo;t know if I wanted to get the black or white model. I knew I wanted printed key-caps, and that made the white board very appealing. The printed keys on it look <em>so crisp</em>. Eventually, I decided on the dark gray because it matches everything else I own, whereas the white board would drastically stick out.</p>

<p>I placed the order and within a few days, it was on my doorstep (well, the neighbor&rsquo;s, but that&rsquo;s an issue with our post&hellip;).</p>

<h2 id="what-i-like">What I like</h2>

<h4 id="layout">Layout</h4>

<p>As already mentioned, I love they HHKB layout. It was a bit tricky to get accustomed to at first, but that was <em>several years</em> ago at this point. The HKKB Pro does have a few difference in layout when compared to the lite version (the pro does not have a bottom left <code>fn</code> key, or any dedicated arrow keys). However, I had prepared myself for this change over the last few years by only using the right <code>fn</code> key and the <code>fn</code> arrow keys. The hardest thing to adjust to was the slightly different sized <code>alt</code> and <code>super</code> keys on the left (due to the missing <code>fn</code> key).</p>

<p>I have learned to appreciate all the little HHKB layout differences. This includes the &ldquo;delete&rdquo; by default backspace key, with the <code>~</code> key above it, and the <code>ESC</code> key next to <code>1</code>. Last but not least, <strong>the CTRL in the CAPS location</strong> <em>(with CAPs still available as <code>fn</code> + <code>Tab</code>)</em>. I honestly think this should be the standard keyboard layout.</p>

<h4 id="pbt-key-caps">PBT key-caps</h4>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect the PBT key-caps to be such a big deal, but I absolutely love them. I could tell from images that they would <em>look</em> better (especially the white ones), but I didn&rsquo;t anticipate how great they would feel. They are solid, but with a soft touch, and are a <em>much</em> better improvement over every keyboard I have previously owned/used.</p>

<h4 id="the-switches">The Switches</h4>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure how I would like the topre switches after getting excited for Cherry MX clears. However, I seem to really like them&hellip; at least on the HHKB. I have heard that they feel different on the HHKB compared to other Topre keyboards due to the HHKBs plastic back. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is true or not, but I like the result. Key presses are smooth but at the same time very crisp. Being a heavy typist, I often bottom out, but when I do it feels very soft, and not harsh at all. I figure that if I am going to bottom out on my keys regardless of what keyboard I have, it is probably best to handle it how the HHKB does.</p>

<h4 id="can-i-say-sound">&hellip; Can I say sound?</h4>

<p>I love the sound of typing on this keyboard. While it is definitely an audible keyboard, it isn&rsquo;t nearly as obnoxious as louder clicky switches, like MX Blues or Greens. It has a soft, muted, lower pitched sound as I type (compared to normal &ldquo;clicky&rdquo; switches). I really do enjoy hearing it, and find myself sometimes taking off my headphones to listen to it if I need motivation to get more characters on the screen.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-don-t-like">What I don&rsquo;t like</h2>

<h4 id="cost">Cost</h4>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned earlier in the post, probably the <em>biggest</em> downside to the HHKB is the substantial cost. At &gt;$230 USD, it is expensive, even for mechanical keyboards. The cost is the single problem that kept me from buying it all these years. Eventually, I realized it is what I wanted, and it would likely last me <em>years</em>, so it all works out. Additionally, if I didn&rsquo;t like the PRO, or didn&rsquo;t want it anymore, they <em>do</em> have an incredible resale value, so I could likely get a large chunk of my money back fairly easily.</p>

<h4 id="transporting-it-related-to-cost">Transporting it (related to cost)</h4>

<p>While the cost issue is mitigated after just biting the bullet and hitting the &ldquo;check out&rdquo; button, there is another minor annoyance that is <em>related</em> to the high price. Ideally, I&rsquo;d like to use my HKKB whenever I am at the computer. Being a software developer&hellip; I use a computer for 8+ hours a day at work. So, I like to use my keyboard at work&hellip; but I also like to bring it home. Ideally, I&rsquo;d get two: one for home and one for at the office. At the high price point though&hellip; I might have to wait to make that purchase. As far as keyboards go, I&rsquo;d say the HHKB is probably one of the best travel boards out there. It&rsquo;s light, but sturdy, and there is even a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Carrying-Happy-Hacking-Keyboard-PD-KB01SD/dp/B000FHSNFW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1514499138&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=HHKB+case go">travel case designed specifically for it</a>. So far I&rsquo;ve been using the box to transport it, but am going to get the traveling case soon. That should hold me over until it is justifiable to get a second board. One day&hellip;</p>

<p><em>I actually was just gifted the carrying case for Christmas. I will check out how it works in the new year. It should at the very least be better than the cardboard box it came in&hellip;</em></p>

<h4 id="mac-mode-delete-fix">&ldquo;Mac&rdquo; mode / Delete &ldquo;fix&rdquo;</h4>

<p>One benefit of getting the HHKB <em>Pro</em> over the <em>lite</em> version, is that it has some media key functionality (volume, start/stop). However, these keys only work when the dip switches are configured to put the board in &ldquo;Mac mode&rdquo;. In addition to enabling the media keys, it changes a few other things, like changing the iconic HHKB &ldquo;Delete&rdquo; key to a more traditional &ldquo;Backspace&rdquo; default. Now, I understand that 99% of people probably welcome this change with open arms. However&hellip; after using the HHKB lite for so many years, I have <em>really</em> become accustomed to the &ldquo;delete&rdquo; key there, and actually prefer it now. With how I jump around my editor/terminals with emacs bindings, I have actually developed a workflow where I use <em>delete</em> more often than <em>backspace</em>.</p>

<p>I cannot figure out a way to have <em>both</em> the <em>mac mode</em> and &ldquo;delete key default&rdquo; functionality enabled at the same time. So&hellip; I have opted to just forgo the new media keys, which is unfortunate. It&rsquo;s a nice upgrade from the <em>lite</em> version, and a shame I can&rsquo;t take advantage of it just because I <em>prefer</em> the default layout of the keyboard.</p>

<h4 id="missing-more-modern-features-perks">Missing more &ldquo;Modern&rdquo; Features/Perks</h4>

<p>The HHKB being a &ldquo;<em>classic</em>&rdquo;, seems to be lacking in some of the more &ldquo;modern&rdquo; features of high-end keyboards. There is no backlighting, no custom programming/macro setups, or wireless connectivity. I even believe that the two USB ports on the back are USB 2, not 3 (let alone C). While it would be <em>nice</em> to have some of these features in the HHKB, I&rsquo;m not hurting <em>too badly</em> for them&hellip; <em>yet</em>. A modern refresh would be amazing though.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>All in all, it is a great keyboard and I plan to use it for a long time. Typing on it feels and sounds so natural, and it has the same layout I have grown to love over the last few years. I am thrilled to finally upgrade to the pro, and wish I did so years ago.</p>
