                    <p>Over the past few months, I&rsquo;ve been considering getting a tablet device for the
first time since I was in college. After researching all sorts of options, I
had myself convinced that I would likely be picking up a <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-9.7/">2018 9.7&rdquo;
iPad</a> at some point. Then I ordered an <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro-10-5">iPad
Pro 10.5&rdquo; (2017 model)</a>.
Here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="why-a-tablet">Why a Tablet?</h2>

<p>When I use technology, I try to plan out and use devices which best fit the
tasks I want to accomplish. After evaluating my work habits, I started to
think that a tablet might function well in many of my use cases.</p>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/keyone.png"><img alt="Blackberry KEYone" src="../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/keyone.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 250px; float: left;"/></a></p>

<p>The main reason? I don&rsquo;t like using smart phones. I think modern phones
are a wonderful piece of technology, but they are often misused. While some
smart phone apps can greatly enhance one&rsquo;s life, many are convenient
distractions.</p>

<p>My phone is <em>always</em> with me, so I keep the set of apps installed on it to a
minimum. I try to use apps that are most needed &ldquo;on the go&rdquo; (maps/lyft,
music/podcasts, and various communication apps). I find that this helps prevent
me from easily distracting myself throughout the day.</p>

<p>Recently, I realized that the experience of some tasks on the phone isn&rsquo;t
great, and that they would likely be best completed on a tablet. Additionally,
setting up a tablet for these apps meant I could still enjoy them in a more
portable way, but maintain a clean, distraction-free phone. Some of the
activities I intended to offload from my phone are:</p>

<h4 id="portable-media-consumption">Portable Media Consumption</h4>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/youtube-logo.png"><img alt="Youtube Logo" src="../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/youtube-logo.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: right; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px;"/></a></p>

<p>I usually consume the majority of my media either on our TV, or at my computer.
That being said, I did start to notice myself watching Youtube, Hulu, and
Netflix, more often from my phone. This usually occurred when the TV was in use,
or I simply wanted to watch from a different location (ex: my bed). Having a
small screen and tinny speakers, watching video on a phone is terrible.
This is especially true on my <a href="https://blackberrymobile.com/us/product/blackberry-keyone/">Blackberry
KEYone&rsquo;s</a> <em>even
smaller</em> screen (Which I choose because it is a great <em>communication device</em>, with a long
battery life. Regardless, even on a large, bezel-less phone screen, watching video
on a smart phone is still sub-optimal).</p>

<p>In college, I used my previous tablet (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_Pad_Transformer">an Asus Transformer
T101</a>, with no dock) to
watch videos in my dorm or around campus. I loved it&rsquo;s convenient, but yet
still enticing viewing experience. I assumed that with a modern tablet,
it would only be better.</p>

<h4 id="reading">Reading</h4>

<p>Being such a visual learner, I tend to gravitate towards visual media. Reading
however, is much less passive than video. When watching a movie, it will
continue to progress whether the viewer is paying attention or not. Reading is
much more <em>self-driven</em>, which I find helps to build my concentration. As a
result, reading is something I am always trying to do more of.</p>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/leanyouahaskell.jpg"><img alt="Learn You A Haskell for Great Good Book" src="../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/leanyouahaskell.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; width: 260px; float: left; margin: 25px 25px 25px 25px; "/></a></p>

<p>I have owned a kindle paperwhite for years, and it is perfect for reading
books.  However, there are some types of reading material that my kindle falls
simply does not handle well.</p>

<p>For example, thanks to <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books/">Humble Book
Bundles</a>, I have acquired a collection of
programming, DevOps, system administration, and general technology ebooks. You
know&hellip; the type of book that is <em>technically</em> classified as a &ldquo;textbook&rdquo;&hellip;
but does not sound nearly as cool when I call it that&hellip;  Anyway the point
is&hellip; they are <em>horrendous</em> to read on the kindle. I would love the ability
to flip through a <em>textbook</em> on a large, color screen, and a tablet enables that.</p>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/pocket-logo.svg"><img alt="Pocket Logo" src="../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/pocket-logo.svg" style="max-width: 100%; width: 175px; float: right; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px; "/></a></p>

<p>Lastly, the internet is full of all sorts of &ldquo;articles&rdquo;. News stories, blog posts,
product announcements, opinion pieces, tutorials, reviews&hellip; all litter the
internet. Recently, I&rsquo;ve been starting to corral this craziness by using tools
such as <a href="https://getpocket.com/">pocket</a> to <em>save</em> articles I <em>want</em> to read.
Then, I can come back and batch-read them later. This helps me break the
endless rabbit-hole of digging through, and semi-reading &ldquo;<em>related</em>&rdquo; articles
(half of which aren&rsquo;t even good).  This practice has worked <em>alright</em> on my
computer, but I do think it would be <em>ideal</em> to sit down in an
armchair with a tablet in my lap, for my batch reads.</p>

<h4 id="offload-some-of-my-smart-phone-use">Offload <em>Some</em> of My Smart Phone Use</h4>

<p>As previously stated, my biggest motivation for buying a tablet is to offload
my phone usage to it. This is particularly true for apps which I am <em>required</em>
to use&hellip; but don&rsquo;t need to have access to at all times.</p>

<p>The best example of this? Banking and other financial apps. I appreciate the
ease of modern banking, and love that I can simply take a picture to deposit a
check. However, I don&rsquo;t need this on my phone. Not only am I unlikely to be
scanning checks and moving money around my bank accounts in public&hellip; it is not
really safe to be doing so. I&rsquo;d rather just wait until I get home on my own
network, and do my banking from a tablet (which stays at home much more
frequently than my phone).</p>

<h3 id="other-options">Other Options</h3>

<h5 id="android-tablets">Android Tablets</h5>

<p>When I started looking at tablets, I quickly noticed that the market had
changed <em>dramatically</em> from a just few years ago. While there are still android
tablets <em>available</em>, the future of Google <em>supporting</em> android on tablets is a
bit unclear. They appear to be trying to shift everything to ChromeOS, as
demonstrated with the <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_slate?hl=en-US">Pixel
Slate</a>.
Additionally, Android still tends to treat tablets as just a large screened phone, and
applications are often not optimized for it. Understandably, I was a little leery about
Android tablets. As for ChromOS tablets, the Slate is currently the only real
contender, but with it&rsquo;s high price point, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jsqZMCPJts">lack-luster
reviews</a>, it was out of the
running.</p>

<h5 id="amazon-fire-tablets">Amazon Fire Tablets</h5>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/firetablet.png"><img alt="Amazon Fire Tablet" src="../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/firetablet.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 300px; float: right; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px; "/></a></p>

<p>In contrast to the pixel slate, at the low end of the tablet market was the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-Tablet-Family/">Amazon Fire Tablet Family</a>.
These devices are quite affordable and would work well for anyone that just
wants to read/watch video on a tablet (especially Amazon content). However, I
just felt that the Fire tablet might be a bit too limiting for me, as I tend to
push technology as far as I can.  Beyond that, the cheaper iterations of each
tablet are the &ldquo;special offers&rdquo; ones, which show amazon ads on the tablet. By
the time I had selected a 10&rdquo; tablet <em>without</em> special offers, the price point
started approaching (well&hellip; almost) another contender&hellip; the 2018 iPad.</p>

<h2 id="why-an-ipad">Why an iPad?</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/ipod-video.png"><img alt="Pocket Logo" src="../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/ipod-video.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin: 20px 20px 10px 10px;"/></a></p>

<h4 id="my-apple-device-history">My Apple Device History</h4>

<p>I originally wanted to do a full <em>multi-paragraph section</em> detailing my limited
use of apple products throughout my life, and how I only really buy them when
they <em>obviously</em> stand out above the competition. But that would be
pretentious, extremely boring, and quite honestly, annoying. So in short: the
only Apple devices that I have owned are 1) an iPod Video, and 2) iPod Touch.
So why am I willing to get an iPad as my tablet device?</p>

<h4 id="ipad">iPad</h4>

<p>While researching, I found that the Apple <em>iPad</em> was consistently
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD1zTrs2EMw">recommended</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7eNq6hTm5E">as
a</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGkr6Cjr0TI"><em>great-value</em></a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3PFt1Y8ZgA">tablet-device</a> on the market
today. Most notably, the 2018 entry-level iPad, which
sold for $330 USD, but could often be found on sale for under $300.</p>

<p>Aimed at the education market, the 2018 iPad saw a cpu upgrade, and support for
the Apple pencil. The only con I ran into people reporting was that because it
didn&rsquo;t have a laminated screen, there was a bit of a &ldquo;gap&rdquo; between it and the
glass. Despite the minor screen issue, this was still the best device I could find
around that price range.</p>

<h4 id="why-the-10-5-pro">Why the 10.5&rdquo; Pro?</h4>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/ipadpro.png"><img alt='iPad 10.5" Pro' src="../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/ipadpro.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 350px; float: right; margin: 20px 20px 10px 10px;"/></a></p>

<p>So&hellip; why did I end up with the 10.5&rdquo; iPad Pro? The switch happened last minute
the morning I ended up ordering it. My upgrade happened because of
two factors:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sale</strong>: The iPad Pro 10.5&rdquo; had gone on a sale at BestBuy, and the
configuration I liked dropped to $499 (from $650). While this was a bit
more expensive, I thought it was still a good deal, and the 2018 iPad
wasn&rsquo;t on sale anywhere so it was the full $330.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Features</strong>: Essentially, the Pro had a slightly larger and <em>much</em> better display, better speakers, and double the storage space (64GB compared to 32GB). These are features that I don&rsquo;t think most people need to care about, I knew I would really appreciate those features, especially now that I could get them for only a ~$170 increase over the iPad, compared to the normal $310 difference.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s the history and reasoning as to <em>why</em> I decided to
get a tablet device, and why that device ultimately ended up being an iPad
10.5&rdquo; Pro. It arrived a couple weeks ago, and I have been enjoying it so far. I
think I&rsquo;ll give myself a bit more time with it, before I even <em>attempt</em> to write any
sort of review.</p>
