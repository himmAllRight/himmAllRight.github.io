                    <p>In my previous post, I discussed how I sold off my System76 Bonobo laptop, and
 planned to replace it with a new computer. Well, I did&hellip; awhile ago. For the
 last few months, I have been using a Lenovo T470 Thinkpad (with dock) as my new
 daily driver. Here are my thoughts.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="the-choice">The Choice</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/my-t470/coffee-picture.jpg"><img alt="T470 Coffee" src="../../img/posts/my-t470/coffee-picture.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">My T470 on a Sunday morning</div></p>

<p>The
<a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470-Core-i5-Full-HD-Notebook-Review.198130.0.html">T470</a>
is the 14&rdquo; model of Lenovo&rsquo;s &ldquo;business&rdquo; laptop lineup. The T470 series actually
has several variants itself, including the &ldquo;high end&rdquo;
<a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470s-Core-i7-WQHD-Laptop-Review.200880.0.html">T470s</a>,
that has a slimmer chassis, made from &ldquo;higher quality materials&rdquo;, and a better
screen compared to the T470. There is also the &ldquo;high
performance&rdquo;<a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470p-Core-i7-GeForce-940MX-Laptop-Review.226802.0.html">T470p</a>,
which features a faster, quad-core CPU, but a slightly larger chassis. While
these variants caught my attention, I ultimately decided on the normal T470.
This was partially because I could max the T470 out at 32GBs of RAM (The T470s
can only hit 24GB due to one of the sticks being soldered in), but mostly
because I assumed that the combination of having a lower powered CPU (compared
to the T70p), but a slightly larger case (compared to the T480s) would make it
the optimal choice concerning my heat/noise concerns outlined in the previous
post.</p>

<h2 id="the-specs">The Specs</h2>

<div class="caption">The Guts of the T470</div></p>

<p>So, the T470 then&hellip;</p>

<p>I got my T470 from a vendor on Ebay. It came configured with a 2.5GHz (3.1 GHz
Turbo) i5-7200u cpu, 8 GBs of DDR4 RAM, a 14&rdquo; 1920x1080 screen, and a 500GB Hard
Drive with Windows 10 on it. After checking that it booted up fine, I
immediately swapped the slow HD with the 250GB SSD that was in my x230, and
installed <a href="https://solus-project.com">Solus</a> on it. In Solus, everything worked
&ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;, and I would guess other Linux distributions would as well. For
Christmas, I got a new 500GB Samsung EVO SSD to upgrade the 250GB one. In total,
the T470 has less total storage than the Bonobo had, but <em>all</em> of it is fast SSD
storage. I am getting better at using my server for network storage anyway, so
it all works out <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>.</p>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/my-t470/solus-install.jpg"><img alt="Solus Install" src="../../img/posts/my-t470/solus-install.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Installing Solus the first night</div></p>

<p>While I still plan to upgrade the T470 in the future, here are it&rsquo;s specs at the
time of writing this post:</p>

<pre><code>T470 Thinkpad
Intel i5-7200u [2.5 Ghz (3.1 Ghz Turbo), 2 Cores, 4 Threads]
8 GB RAM
500 GB Samsung EVO SSD
14&quot; 1920x1080 IPS Display 
Solus
</code></pre>

<p>The hardware on the T470 is nice, and the technical specs are <em>okay</em>, but the
real killer feature of switching to a Thinkpad for my main computer is that I
also purchased the ThinkPad Ultra Dock (40A2). This means that I am able to
<em>easily</em> take advantage of my periphery devices whenever I am working at my
desk.</p>

<pre><code>Thinkpad Ultra Dock 40A2
2 x 23.6&quot; ASUS 1920x1080 Monitors
Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro2 
Audioengine A2+ Speakers &amp; Stands
Bose AE2 Headphones
Logitech HD Pro Webcam c920 Widescreen
Blue Yeti Microphone - Backout Edition
Inateck USB 3.0 to SATA Dual-Bay Hard Drive Docking Station

<h2 id="what-i-like">What I like</h2>

<div class="caption">I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the portability and great keyboard of the T470</div></p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve provided some background information and a summary, I&rsquo;ll quickly
list what I <em>like</em> and <em>do not like</em> about my new T470.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cool &amp; Quiet</strong> - After realizing that I am picky about heat and noise in
computers, one of my biggest goals when replacing my old computer was to find
one that ran cooler and quieter. I think I did well here. <em>This thing is
silent.</em> Using one of my new favorite command line applications,
<a href="https://amanusk.github.io/s-tui/">s-tui</a>, I have observed that most of the
time when I&rsquo;m writing code, browsing the web, or listening to music, the fans
in the T470 don&rsquo;t even kick on. When I do push the machine a little by
running VMs, or being on a video conference, the do kick up, but even then I
have to put my ear right against the computer to hear anything. At it&rsquo;s
loudest, the T470 is still a very quiet device.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Size &amp; Portability</strong> - I love the size and portability of this laptop. The
14&rdquo; form factor is large enough that I don&rsquo;t feel cramped when using it as a
stand-alone device, but still small enough that I can easily throw it in my
bag and bring it with me. While I wouldn&rsquo;t mind the T470 shedding a <em>little</em>
weight (which is mostly from the battery), I find it&rsquo;s thickness perfectly
acceptable for my uses (hear that Apple?). As far as build quality, it is a
solid machine. When I rest my hands on it to type, they feel fully supported
and there is <em>zero</em> flex. When holding the closed laptop, it feels as though
it could take quite a beating and still be fine. I love that.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Keyboard &amp; Track-point/pad</strong> - It&rsquo;s a Thinkpad keyboard, what else do I have
to say? The keys are adequately spaced, have travel (though not as much as my
x230), and feel <em>crisp</em> when pressed, not mushy. It has a track<em>point</em> with
physical buttons, which at this point I don&rsquo;t think I could do without (Crap.
Unintentional pun. Oh well, I&rsquo;m leaving it.). While I don&rsquo;t use it often, the
track<em>pad</em> is also quite nice. I find it to be an ideal size, and has
rubberized texture which prevents my fingers from feeling raw after long use.
I find it hard these days for others laptops to compete with the Thinkpad&rsquo;s
keyboard/track-point setup.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Dock-able</strong> - I&rsquo;ve already mentioned this above, but I love that the T470 is
dock-able. This is becoming more common with the pervasiveness of USB-C, but
Thinkpads have been in the dock game for years. It works well, and fits my
current computing use-case perfectly.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Thunderbolt/USB C</strong> - The big difference between the T470 and the T460
essentially comes down to the Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port on the T470. I don&rsquo;t
use it much <em>so far</em>, but I hope the industry continues the move down the this
route, and I will be glad to already have the port as they do.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Battery(s)</strong> - The battery configuration and life on this laptop is great.
The T470 can get a 3-cell battery that doesn&rsquo;t stick out, or an extended
battery that comes in 6 and 9 cell variations (Note: the 6 and 9 cell are the
same size). The T470 also supports an internal 3 cell battery, that can be
used to keep the laptop powered on while the external battery is swapped. I
currently have the least optimal configuration: A bulky 6-cell external, with
no internal battery. Even so, it easily lasts me throughout the day, and I can
always upgrade it down the road. I love the flexibility.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-i-don-t-like">What I don&rsquo;t like</h2>

<p>While I overall love the T470, there are a few things I&rsquo;m not thrilled about.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Screen</strong> - When I first got my laptop&hellip; I thought the screen was
defective. I had read in reviews that it wasn&rsquo;t very <em>bright</em>, but the colors
were terrible. My screen always looked as if I was using something like
<a href="https://justgetflux.com/">f.lux</a>. After doing some reading, it turns out that
IPS panels (which I had never owned before) can appear warmer in color. That
combined with the low brightness and <em>not great</em> color accuracy of the T470
panel, made it appear particularly awful to me. I found and configured a <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/uploads/tx_nbc2/N140HCA_EAB_01.icm">ICC
file</a> which
helped, but the biggest fix was time. As terrible as it was at first, I really
don&rsquo;t mind the screen. Yea, it could be brighter with better colors, but now I
think it looks nice, and colors on top of black really pop.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Track-point</strong> - I stated in the section above that the track-point was one of
the features I loved about this laptop. That is true&hellip; but, if I <em>had</em> to get
picky, the track-point itself is not that great. It&rsquo;s hard to move around with
and it&rsquo;s sensitivity differs depending on which direction it is traveling. At
times it can be a real pain. By contrast, my x230 is very stable and precise.
I wish the T470&rsquo;s track-point was like the one on my x230&rsquo;s.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Graphics</strong> - I can&rsquo;t complain too much here because I knew what I was
getting myself into, but&hellip; the graphics performance isn&rsquo;t the best. I know
<em>not</em> having dedicated graphics is what allows the T470 to run cool and sip
power, but I wouldn&rsquo;t mind a <em>little</em> more umph. I don&rsquo;t expect to do heavy
gaming on the T470. If I want to game, I am going to build a gaming computer.
However, I do wish I could play basic games a <em>little</em> better in the meantime.
(<em>On the bright side&hellip;with the thunderbolt 3 port&hellip; an eGPU is a
possibility&hellip;hmmm&hellip;</em>)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2>

<p><a href="../../img/posts/my-t470/ram-upgrade.jpg"><img alt="T470 Ram Slot" src="../../img/posts/my-t470/ram-upgrade.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The empty RAM slot I hope to add a 16GB stick to&hellip; if prices ever drop again&hellip;</div></p>

<p>Overall, I have been very happy with the T470 as my main computer. I&rsquo;d still
like to upgrade the RAM at some point, and I <em>have</em> entertained the idea of
trying an eGPU setup&hellip; I might <em>eventually</em> build a new desktop, but even then,
I would likely have it headless, running VMs and connect to it remotely from the
T470 (except for occasional gaming). That being said, right now, the T470 is
working great as is!</p>
