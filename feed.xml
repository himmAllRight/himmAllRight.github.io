My New Dotfiles Management - Using GNU Stow
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I have maintained a &quot;dotfiles&quot; repository since I made my github account in 2013. However, overtime it became more of a post-apocalyptic wasteland, cluttered with remnants of obsolete configurations and scraps of scripts. It was no longer the pristine, culled, collection that I desired. I also did not have an efficient method of easily linking the files on a new system. I had to manually make symlinks for each dotfile. I knew there were &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better dotfiles setups out there, but I never got around to it. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!&amp;ndash; more&amp;ndash;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, after reading &lt;a href='http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html'&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, I finally decided to sit down and clean up my dotfiles directory. I wanted to re-organize it so that I could use &lt;a href='http://freecode.com/projects/gnustow'&gt;GNU Stow&lt;/a&gt; to initialize my dotfiles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After setting it all up, I decided to just start from scratch with a &lt;a href='https://github.com/himmAllRight/dotfiles'&gt;new repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;using&amp;#95;stow&amp;#95;and&amp;#95;dotfiles&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Using Stow and dotfiles&lt;/h2&gt;If you haven't seen it before, I highly suggest reading the post I have linked above. But in the meantime, I can provide a quick summary of how my dotfiles are setup. &lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/new-dotfiles/dotfiles.png&quot; alt=&quot;My Dotfiles Dir&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each application has an associated sub-directory (ex: &lt;code&gt;dotfiles/emacs&lt;/code&gt;), which contains all of the dotfiles/folders associated with that application. Structurally, I treat the items in each application directory as if they were in my &lt;code&gt;&amp;#126;&lt;/code&gt;. For example, the &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; sub-directory has my &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt;, as well as the &lt;code&gt;.vim/colors/&lt;/code&gt; directory. This is so that when I use stow, it will properly link them in &lt;code&gt;&amp;#126;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/new-dotfiles/vim-dots.png&quot; alt=&quot;Vim dotfiles directory&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I setup my dotfiles on a new system, or install an application for which I already have dotfiles saved for, setting them up is as easy as typing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;code&gt;stow application-dir&lt;/code&gt; (ex: &lt;code&gt;stow vim&lt;/code&gt;).   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GNU Stow then links the files under my home directory. In my vim example, this means symlinks are created for &lt;code&gt;&amp;#126;/.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;#126;/.vim/colors/&amp;#42;&lt;/code&gt;, pointing to their respective locations in &lt;code&gt;&amp;#126;/dotfiles/vim/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/new-dotfiles/vim-home.png&quot; alt=&quot;Vim dotfiles in Home&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this setup is brilliant. Initializing an application's directory is so simple, and I can choose to only initialize specific sub-directories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, I might make multiple branches of the repository, one for each of my computers, so I can maintain specific configurations. In theory, I could also just make different folders (ex &lt;code&gt;vim-laptop&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vim-server&lt;/code&gt;), but I like the branch idea better because it's a little easier for me to merge changes. We shall see. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that's the new setup. Enjoy :-D&lt;/p&gt;

Linux from Scratch - Getting Started
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;When I started using &lt;a href='https://www.archlinux.org'&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt; a while back, I learn about some of the internals of Linux quickly. Ever since then, I have considered building a Linux From Scratch by following the guidelines outlined in &lt;a href='http://www.linuxfromscratch.org'&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt;. Based on my experience with Arch Linux, I'm sure that compiling a system from scratch will continue to teach me about Linux at a much deeper level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!&amp;ndash; more &amp;ndash;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;getting&amp;#95;started&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/LFS-intro/book-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Linux from Scratch Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, it should be known that this process follows a book that is freely available at &lt;a href='http://www.linuxfromscratch.org'&gt;www.linuxfromscratch.org&lt;/a&gt;. The book is updated from time to time, and there are several versions of it (ex: systemd or not). I am attempting to complete the systemd adaptation. There are also many videos online of people walking through the steps. I find watching such videos can be very helpful to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;setting&amp;#95;up&amp;#95;the&amp;#95;host&amp;#95;system&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Setting Up the Host System&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/LFS-intro/VM-install.png&quot; alt=&quot;VM installation Complete&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;LFS is constructed from a host environment that has the software required to build and compile all the components of the system. This host system can be a current Linux install, a seperate computer that is dedicated to LFS, or a Linux virtual machine. The LFS system is then assembled in a another partition, or even on a separate hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I setup a KVM virtual machine using Virt Manager for my host system, and then attached a virtual hard drive to build LFS on. I decided to use a &lt;a href='https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop'&gt;Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop&lt;/a&gt; install because it should have most of the build tools, and it is easy to install any missing ones. For now, I configured the VM to use 4 cores and 4GB of RAM, but I might decide to increase that when I start compiling packages. I also decided to not worry about any of the fancy partitioning options like setting up LVM or disk encryption, and just let the installer automatically do it for me. Those features are not really needed here and I figured it would just potentially confuse me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/LFS-intro/HD-add.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adding LFS hd&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the VM finished installing, I shutdown the system and added a virtual drive. This will be the virtual drive that I build the entire LFS system in. Then I started up the VM again, confirmed that everything installed correctly, and installed openssh so that I could just ssh into the system from my desktop if I didn't feel like working inside the VM's GUI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;setting&amp;#95;up&amp;#95;the&amp;#95;host&amp;#95;environment&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Setting up the Host Environment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;checking&amp;#95;required&amp;#95;packages&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Checking Required Packages&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/LFS-intro/environment-check-pre.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adding LFS hd&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the host system was setup, the host &lt;em&gt;environment&lt;/em&gt; had to be configured. Luckily, LFS provides a nice script that can be copy and pasted into a terminal. This script prints out what required packages and programs are not yet installed on the system (make sure to run it as either root, or using sudo). When I ran the script, there were a few missing packages that had to be installed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;bison&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;gawk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;texinfo (makeinfo)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I just ran a simple &lt;code&gt;apt-get install bison gawk texinfo&lt;/code&gt; command and was good to go. I also had a symlink issue because &lt;code&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt; was pointing to &lt;code&gt;/bin/dash&lt;/code&gt;, and LFS wants it to point to &lt;code&gt;/bin/bash/&lt;/code&gt;. This was easily resolved using the command &lt;code&gt;ln -sf bash /bin/sh&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/LFS-intro/environment-check-post.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adding LFS hd&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After installing those few packages and fixing the symlink, the check script was happy, and I could move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;checking&amp;#95;libraries&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Checking Libraries&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/LFS-intro/library-check.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adding LFS hd&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;After verifying that my host system had all the required packages, I had to confirm that a few libraries were &quot;consistent&quot;. Again, LFS provides a simple script for this. When I ran it, the three libraries were not found. Tthe books states that all the files should either be &lt;em&gt;absent&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;present&lt;/em&gt;. If one or two are there and the others missing, that is a problem. So my system was okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;formatting&amp;#95;the&amp;#95;lfs&amp;#95;disk&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Formatting the LFS Disk&lt;/h3&gt;I added my LFS disk through the Virt Manager settings, which doesn't format it, so that had to be done next. &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/LFS-intro/disks.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adding LFS hd&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first used &lt;code&gt;lsblk&lt;/code&gt; to confirm the disk name. In my case it was the &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdb&lt;/code&gt; disk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/LFS-intro/mkfs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adding LFS hd&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting the disk's path, it was time to format. I decided to format the disk with t the basic, but very solid ext4 file system using the following command (again, as root or using &lt;em&gt;sudo&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkfs.ext4 -v /dev/sdb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the &lt;code&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt; was not required, but I personally prefer to see the output. Also, if I wanted to specify the drive using the UUID, that could be accomlished using the &lt;code&gt;-U&lt;/code&gt; flag to specify a UUID instead of the file path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next few preparatory steps before starting to build LFS must be done each time the host system boots, so I think I am going to break that into a separate post. That way, it can be more easily referenced. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

Introducing Kadabra - My New, Used x230
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;As I start to do more with a computer on the go, the netbooks I previously used just are not cutting it anymore. They were great for minimal use, but couldn't run VMs, over-heated, and didn't have great battery life. Now that I am going to libraries and other locations to work on personal and open source projects, I really needed a better mobile pc setup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!&amp;ndash; more &amp;ndash;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;other&amp;#95;considerations&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Other Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/introducing-kadabra/asus_x201e.png&quot; alt=&quot;Asus x201e&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had been keeping an eye open for a new mobile computer for well over a year to find out what is out there. I mostly looked sub $300 ubuntu laptops like the Asus 11&quot;  celeron (x201e) I got in college. I don't need much HD space on my portable computer, because I usually use a minimal OS, and only have my projects (which are git controlled), and sometimes a  &lt;i&gt;little bit&lt;/i&gt; of music. Even with dropping my requirements to computers with &lt;i&gt;very tiny&lt;/i&gt; HDs (often &lt; 60GB), none of the options seemed all that impressive. They usually had Celeron processors and little ram. Even worse, they were not easily expandable. I also briefly entertained the idea of putting Linux on a chrome book, but they had the same issues that all the other sub $300 options had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;used&amp;#95;thinkpads&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Used Thinkpads&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I intensified my search, I started to consider other options. There is one alternative that is very popular among Linux users, but I always seem to forget about it when looking for a new device. That option of course, is buying a used Thinkpad and installing Linux on it. This appeared to be an ideal time to try it out. I don't mind if there is a scratch or two on a cheap device. This is my portable computer after all, so I'm sure a shinny new device wouldn't stay pristine for long anyway. So, I started researching used Thinkpads and loved how much you could get for the money. There were i5 devices with an acceptable bit of ram and &quot;okay&quot; hard drives for under my $300 price point. Better yet, the Thinkpads seemed easy to upgrade .  So, even if the device had a bad battery, or needed a RAM/HD upgrade, &lt;i&gt;I could could do it&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I eventually narrowed my search down to the X230 or T430s. That year's model seemed like the perfect mix of still being relatively new, while  also being old enough that many business had started to replace them, flooding the market and driving the cost down. They also didn't have the terrible track pad that the x240 and T440s had (without buttons). I eventually decided on the x230 because the main use of this laptop would be portability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;this&amp;#95;particular&amp;#95;thinkpad&amp;#95;x230&amp;#95;...&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This Particular Thinkpad x230 ...&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/introducing-kadabra/kadabra2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kadabra&quot; /&gt;I found my used x230 on Amazon, for about $185. The vendor an acceptable rating, and the specs were good for the price:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intel i5-3320M&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 GB RAM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12.5&quot; 1366x768 HD LED Display&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;320 GB HHD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The listing also said that it came with a &quot;used 6-cell battery&quot;. So I planned from the beginning to have it replaced. Sure enough, when the laptop arrived,  the battery was completely dead. If I unplugged the laptop, it would shutdown.  So, I ordered a 9-cell battery online to replace it. I added a 4GB stick of RAM that I took from an older laptop, and replaced the slow HHD (with Windows pre-installed), with a cheap 120GB SSD I had lying around. After installing Korora 24 on the new SSD, I had a nice, portable computer that only cost me about $200 (plus some spare parts). As advertised, swapping the battery, adding RAM, and replacing the HD were &lt;i&gt;super simple&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;accessible&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;what&amp;#95;i&amp;#95;like&amp;#95;about&amp;#95;it&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What I like about it&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track point&lt;/strong&gt; - I love track points. Using other laptops withjust track-pads is really frustrating now. I completely understand why  people are so crazy about them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keyboard&lt;/strong&gt; - The keyboard really is great. I feels solid and not like  other laptop keyboards. It gives good feedback and is very nice to type on. I know many  people hate this model because keyboard layout changed from the  older models like the x220, but I still think the x230 has a better  keyboard than most laptops.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical buttons&lt;/strong&gt; - The x230 has a physical mute, volume control, and  mic buttons. This is a feature I enjoy much more than I thought I  would.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgradability&lt;/strong&gt; - As I have already mentioned, it is &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; easy  to upgrade the x230. Right when I got it, I replaced the HHD with an  SSD and added another stick of RAM in under five  minutes. In fact, I have swapped the SSD out temporarily witha second drive several times now to try out different distros on the  hardware. It is just so easy to do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feel&lt;/strong&gt; - I really like how this laptop feels. I've already  mentioned that I enjoy the solidness of the keyboard, but I also  love the exterior texture of the case. It has a slight rubbery  feel to it that makes it easy to hold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bang for your buck&lt;/strong&gt; - Getting a used thinkpad really is a  great deal. Even counting the minor upgrades I installed, I was able  to get &lt;i&gt;an actual computer&lt;/i&gt; for around the same price as the   &lt;i&gt;netbook&lt;/i&gt; alternatives I was looking at.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; - This is my mobile computer, so I need it to be  small. While it isn't as thin as my wife's macbook air, it is still  very portable. I actually don't mind it being a little bit thicker,  as I find it to be the perfect size to hold and carry around. It is  a similar size to a few of my programming books and slides into my  backpack very easily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;what&amp;#95;i&amp;#95;don't&amp;#95;like&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What I don't like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has a little bit of flex&lt;/strong&gt; - While the laptop overall feels pretty  solid, the screen does have a bit of flex when pressed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolution&lt;/strong&gt; - I really hate 1366x768 on laptops. I don't need 1920x1080, which would be very tiny on a 12.5&quot; screen. 1600x900 however...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track pad (but honestly who cares)&lt;/strong&gt; - The track-pad isn't great. In fact, it can be downright annoying. The bottom of the track-pad curves around the edge of computer, which looks nice, but rubs against my stomach when I am working with the laptop on my lap. This causes the cursor to fly around and do everything but what I want it to do. This would be a much bigger issue on other laptops, but with how much I use the track point, I really don't care. I usually just disable the track-pad all together.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers aren't great (but again, not a bit deal)&lt;/strong&gt; - The speakers are very quiet and don't  sound very good. This isn't a huge deal for me because being my mobile computer, I am using  headphones 99% of the time. Still, it would be nice if when I occasionally share a video with someone they could actually hear it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/introducing-kadabra/kadabra.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kadabra&quot; /&gt;I have had Kadabra for several months now and still love it. I use it at work daily (to listen tomusic, podcasts, and to have a &lt;i&gt;linux&lt;/i&gt; computer available to me at all times in a Windows office). It is a perfect mix of being portable while still having enough power to accomplish whatever I want to work on. I still prefer to vote with my wallet by purchasing from a vendors like &lt;a href='http://www.system76.com'&gt;System76&lt;/a&gt; when possible, but buying used business hardware, such as thinkpads, is a very affordable alternative. I have no regrets buying my used x230. It is infinitely better than my other options at that price point.&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;update&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Update&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;I have taken so long to publish this post, I am actually now using Arch Linux on Kadabra. It also runs great :)&lt;/i&gt;

Trying out snapd on Arch Linux
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks I have been listening to all of the buzz about Ubuntu &quot;snaps&quot;, but I just recently decided to try this new technology out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!&amp;ndash; more &amp;ndash;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;snapd&amp;#95;install&amp;#95;and&amp;#95;setup&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Snapd Install and Setup&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to install snapd on my small netbook (Abra), which is running Arch Linux. So, installing snapd was as easy as running:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacaur -S snapd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I use pacaur so that I can install packages from Arch Linux's main repos, as well as the AUR. However, because snapd has actually been moved to the community repos, you can install it with vanilla pacman, without aur support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S snapd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After snapd is installed, it needs to be started. To start the snapd service, just use systemd:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl start snapd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, If you want to start the snapd service automatically after a reboot run the command:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl enable snapd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;using&amp;#95;snap&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Using snap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After snapd was installed and running, I started playing with the snap application. The first thing I should note is that to the extent of my knowledge, snap has to be run as root (at least for now). So my commands all start with &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, I wanted to find a snap package. This can be done using the &lt;code&gt;snap find&lt;/code&gt; command as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo snap find package-name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(where &lt;strong&gt;package-name&lt;/strong&gt; is the name of the package to search)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/arch-snaps/snap-find.png&quot; alt=&quot;Finding Snaps&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like in any standard package manager search, the potential matches were returned, along with a version number, the developer name, and a summary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snap has several other commands. To see a full list of available snap commands and a description for each one, just type:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo snap help&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/arch-snaps/snap-help.png&quot; alt=&quot;Snap Help&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;testing&amp;#95;a&amp;#95;snap&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Testing a snap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After learning about the basic snap commands, I wanted to install a snap to see how well it works. I decided to see if there was a Telegram snap (I heard there was, so it was a good bet). I ran &lt;code&gt;sudo snap find telegram&lt;/code&gt;, and a list of my options appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/arch-snaps/snap-telegram-install.png&quot; alt=&quot;Snap telegram&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I choose the last one, and installed it using the command  &lt;code&gt;sudo snap install telegram-serguisens&lt;/code&gt;. A progress bar tracked the download of the snap, and then the installation. That was it. To my delight, within a few seconds the Ubuntu &lt;code&gt;snap&lt;/code&gt; application had downloaded the telegram snap, and installed it on my &lt;i&gt;arch linux&lt;/i&gt; box, without any issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;my&amp;#95;only&amp;#95;issue&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My Only Issue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/arch-snaps/snap-telegram-menu.png&quot; alt=&quot;Snap Help&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well... &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; without any issues. The one problem I did have was after installing the telegram snap, the executable wasn't in my path so I couldn't start it from my launcher or even a terminal. I think this was actually because snapd wasn't setup fully. I rebooted my computer and telegram now launches just fine. The snap is even identified with its full name (&lt;i&gt;telegram-serguisens&lt;/i&gt;), so I can be sure it is the actual snap, and not another Telegram install.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;thoughts&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/arch-snaps/snap-telegram.png&quot; alt=&quot;Snap Help&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the fact that snaps are easy to package and install for developers and users alike, I think my favorite feature was something that I didn't even think about prior to trying it out, and I might not of realized had I installed snapd on another computer...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This little computer is low power, and tends to heat up and go crazy when I install certain packages (particularly ones from the AUR). Sometimes it is so bad that I have to kill the installation and forego that application for awhile. Telegram is one of them. I think this is because the aur build pulls down the telegram .deb package and then has to extract and compile it in order to install it on Arch. This little computer doesn't like that. The snap however, seems to of just download and installed itself. It hardly pegged my CPU at all. If this is true, snaps might have an additional use-case on weaker hardware, like my netbook. (yes, I know snaps might have a bigger disk footprint, but honestly that trade-off is fine with me)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the universal application frameworks are a great idea that is very much needed on Linux. Snapd is very promising and I look forward to seeing what it and other solutions have in store for the future of Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

Trying Out the Plasma 5 Desktop Environment
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;After watching the continued development of the Plasma 5 desktop environment from a distance, I determined I needed to give it another try. It was just before version 5.6 was released, and the project appeared to be finding it's stride. Right up front, I want to come clean and admit that I have never really liked the KDE/Plasma desktop environment (more on that below). However, with that said... I am still using the plasma desktop on my main computer (months later, and haven't aborted yet**...). Here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!&amp;ndash; more &amp;ndash;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;my&amp;#95;history&amp;#95;with&amp;#95;kde/plasma&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My History with KDE/Plasma&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as I said above, &lt;i&gt;I have never really liked KDE (now Plasma)&lt;/i&gt;. In fact, sometimes I down right &lt;i&gt;hated&lt;/i&gt; it. It is a great project, and I &lt;i&gt;wanted&lt;/i&gt; to like it. It has so many features and is amazing for power users. I have tried it again and again, desperately wanting to be swept off my feet, but it's design always kept me bolted to the ground. The theming made me feel like I was using a Fisher-Price operating system (which is ironic, because like I said... the plasma desktop is probably one of the best power user environments out there). The bulky features always made it feel childish. So, with that said... I have been using using the Plasma desktop on all of my personal computers for several months. Here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The theming has come a long way&lt;/strong&gt;. It no longer looks like a  child's toy. Even the default theme is &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; appealing. Also, it  has &lt;em&gt;dark themes&lt;/em&gt;, which I am always a fan of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/plasma-desktop/default-plasma.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Default KDE Plasma 5.6 Desktop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I Love the customization.&lt;/strong&gt; I love the level of customization  the plasma desktop allows. I can set transparency, add/remove  panels or widgets, set custom keybindings (very important to me),  and a bunch of other operations very easily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/plasma-desktop/settings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plasma Settings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lets me hide window bars&lt;/strong&gt; One customization I love is the ability  to hide the window bars. I am not a fan of window bars, because I  think they look clunky and just take up space. One feature I like  about many tiling window managers is it is usually very easy to hide  the window bars. However, that isn't always the case in Desktop  Environments, but I was pleased with how easy it was to do it in  Plasma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It Lets me create an awesome-wm environment, but as a full DE&lt;/strong&gt;  Similar to above, I am able to implement some of the features I love  about tiling window managers like awesome and i3, but with the full  desktop environment. In addition to removing window bars, I like to  easily move and resize windows by hitting the meta or alt key and  left/right clicking the windows. Again, in Plasma this was simple.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love krunner. A lot.&lt;/strong&gt; I like using application launchers, and  krunner looks nice, is lightning fast, and gets the job done. I  didn't really know much about krunner during previous attempts at  using KDE. This was definitely contributor to why I liked it much  more this time around.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/plasma-desktop/krunner.png&quot; alt=&quot;Plasma Settings&quot; /&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ability to use old-school animations is fun&lt;/strong&gt; There is not much to say  here. While not very practical, sometimes spinning a desktop cube is  just straight up &lt;i&gt;fun&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/plasma-desktop/cube.png&quot; alt=&quot;Desktop Cube&quot; /&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast. Even for a full DE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-monitor support. WTF.&lt;/strong&gt; This was by far the biggest issue I  had. My main computer is a 17&quot; laptop that I connect to two 24&quot;  displays. However, because it is a indeed a laptop, I sometimes move  it around and be semi-mobile with it. This requires disconnecting the  monitors and going from 1 screen to 3 or vice-versa. Well it turns  out that this is usually a pain in the ass for me in Plasma. First,  I have to configure the monitors one-by-one, hitting &quot;apply&quot; between  each configuration (it doesn't like when I try to move and place all  3 displays in one swoop). Second, once I setup the screen placement,  the panels often go crazy and can't be found, or I have to play  with them to set them up correctly. Lastly, sometimes the displays  overlap each other oddly, even though they appear normal in the  display settings. The wallpapers almost never set correctly and my  right-click menu is disabled on some screens but not  others. Basically, it's just a hot mess and the most infuriating  problem I faced when using Plasma. If I used a laptop without  monitors, or even a permanent desktop setup, I would be  fine. However, that is not my use case.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/plasma-desktop/wtf-multi-monitor.png&quot; alt=&quot;Plasma Settings&quot; /&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Randomly just stops working&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes, KDE applications just  crash and I can't seem to get them back. Widgets seemed to beak  things more frequently, so I just stopped using them. (Again, not a  good solution)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A full DE&lt;/strong&gt; While I said above that it was nice having an  environment that resembled a window manager, but had the benefit of  the full suite of applications that come with a desktop environment,  sometimes it was also a pain. There's just a lot of crap that I  don't use. The obvious reminder of this was when I would run  &lt;code&gt;pacman -Syu&lt;/code&gt;, and see that the massive KDE stack would need  updates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes all the settings can be very confusing&lt;/strong&gt; Having all  these options is great, but sometimes it was  overwhelming. Additionally, the settings felt disjointed and I  didn't know where the settings for some things where.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;final&amp;#95;thoughts&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can finally use Plasma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very fast and lightweight for all that it is&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Still has a bit of stability/polish work to go&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;** &lt;i&gt;Update: I took forever to get this post out and I have actually moved off of Plasma. I just couldn't handle the multi-monitor issues I had. However, I will definitely be trying out the Desktop Environment again in the future (I moved to i3-gaps for now. I love my tiling window managers :) )&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Using Cryogen for Website
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Ever since resurrecting my personal website, I have experimented with several static website generators. Thus far, I have tried &lt;a href='https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page'&gt;org-page&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href='http://jekyllrb.com/'&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;i&gt;several&lt;/i&gt; times), and even (almost) made  &lt;a href='https://github.com/himmAllRight/ryBlog/blob/master/org-blog.el'&gt;my own emacs org-page solution&lt;/a&gt;. Now that I have started using the &lt;a href='http://clojure.org/'&gt;clojure&lt;/a&gt; programming language, I have come across &lt;a href='http://cryogenweb.org/'&gt;cryogen&lt;/a&gt;. As you may have already guessed, this site is now being generated using cryogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!&amp;ndash; more &amp;ndash;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;emacs/org-mode&amp;#95;solutions&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Emacs/org-mode Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/using-cryogen-for-website/Emacs-icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;emacs logo&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/using-cryogen-for-website/org-mode-unicorn.png&quot; alt=&quot;org-mode unicorn&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, obsession with &lt;a href='https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/'&gt;emacs&lt;/a&gt; (and more importantly, org-mode) eventually led me to try out &lt;a href='https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page'&gt;org-page&lt;/a&gt; while revitalizing my personal website. The idea of writing webpage content in .org files was &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; appealing and I wanted to gain a more experience writing emacs lisp, so it seemed like a good choice. Overall, org-page was a good learning experience, but I found the documentation and support to be lacking. It seemed to be more of a &lt;a href='http://kelvinh.github.io/'&gt;personal project&lt;/a&gt;, rather than a fully supported framework. while I know &lt;a href='http://cmacr.ae/'&gt;other people&lt;/a&gt; were able to get it working, org-page simply wasn't working for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For over a year now, I have used org-mode at work each week to track my hours and to take notes (including code snippets). I then export the org files to html, creating a full index of my work notes/logs. After digging deeper into org-page, realized it was just a fancy wrapper around the org-project functions I used at work. So, I decided to implment &lt;a href='https://github.com/himmAllRight/ryBlog/blob/master/org-blog.el'&gt;my own emacs org-page solution&lt;/a&gt; (well, &lt;i&gt;half&lt;/i&gt; implement... I guess I never fully finished it). Creating my own solution helped me learn even more about org-mode (which helped with my work notes), but I ultimately abandoned using this method for my personal website. Managing my own solution quickly became a pain because I had to setup emacs, install the dependencies, and get a &lt;i&gt;.emacs&lt;/i&gt; file working &lt;i&gt;just right&lt;/i&gt; on any compuer I wanted to generate the site from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;jekyll&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/using-cryogen-for-website/jekyll.png&quot; alt=&quot;jekyll logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first experience with &lt;a href='http://jekyllrb.com/'&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; was about two years ago, right after I graduated college. It was the first true static website generator that I tried and I absolutely loved the concept. You see, I taught myself how to build websites in the early to mid 2000's when I was in middle school, and apparently never developed beyond that point. During college, I maintained a personal site by hand. It was super simplistic html that used tables for the layout, and css for coloring. That's about it. Using a static website generator like Jekyll for the first time was amazing, since it automatically produced static webpages that looked &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; better than anything I could do by hand. All I had to worry about was the content. It was what 12-year-old-me longed for (and tried to do using iframes and other messiness). I eventually stopped using Jekyll because I was unable to get the theming quite right, and ... well ... I started &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; getting into emacs. But you've already heard that story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After taking a breif hiatus from Jekyll to adventure deeper into emacs land, I returned. This time, I was able to find and configure a &lt;a href='https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno'&gt;enticing theme&lt;/a&gt; that fit my needs. My personal website probably looked the best is ever has, and I really enjoyed it. However, I have recently become frusterated using Jekyll (again). It is a great static website generator, but because I don't often develop in Ruby (right now), setting up the proper ruby gems environment and dependencies on &lt;a href='../../pages/homelab/'&gt;my computers&lt;/a&gt; makes me want to bang my head against the wall. Additionally, I have been learning &lt;a href='http://clojure.org/'&gt;clojure&lt;/a&gt; and while digging through different clojure projects, I found &lt;a href='http://cryogenweb.org/'&gt;cryogen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;cryogen&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Cryogen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/using-cryogen-for-website/cryogen.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cryogen logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://cryogenweb.org/'&gt;Cryogen&lt;/a&gt; is a static website generator written in &lt;a href='https://clojure.org/'&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt;.  If you already have &lt;a href='http://leiningen.org/'&gt;Leiningen&lt;/a&gt; installed (which if using Clojure, you should), starting a new Cryogen application is as easy as entering &lt;code&gt;lein new cryogen project-name&lt;/code&gt; into a terminal. Once the project is created, you can &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into the directory and run &lt;code&gt;lein ring server&lt;/code&gt;. Clojure will then fire up a local webserver of the compiled project (by default on port 3000). Whenever a change to a project file is saved, the cryogen server re-compiles the project and updates the webserver. As a result, it easy to edit and see the changes live. Cryogen has a rather large, but simple &lt;a href='http://cryogenweb.org/docs/structure.html'&gt;directory structure&lt;/a&gt; that is used to organize the project. This structure is slightly different from Jekyll, and takes a bit of getting to, but I think it does a better job at keeping everything organized once you learn it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one thing I &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; like about Cryogen is the fact that... well... it's clojure. This means that things can often feel more &quot;lisp-y&quot;. For example, in Jekyll, the preferences and configuration of the website are kept inside a yaml configuration file. Similarly, the meta-data and information for a page or blog post are defined in a very specific yaml header at the top of the markdown files. Cryogen follows a similar concept, but instead of yaml headers, it simply uses a p-list for the &lt;a href='http://cryogenweb.org/docs/configuration.html'&gt;configuration setup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To change a post's information (ex: title, author, date), one just has to change the keywords in the list at the top of the post's markdown file. This flexability means that figuring out how to setup use my own configuration was a breeze. For programmers that have previously used Clojure or another LISP, the configuration in Cryogen is very intuitive and natural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only &lt;i&gt;downside&lt;/i&gt; (sort of... it's my fault) I have experienced while using Cryogen is that being a smaller community, there isn't much out there in terms of templetes and themes (at least that I was able to find during a lazy search). So, while I was able to easily setup an amazing looking website using Jekyll (by using someone else's hard work), I am forced to be a bit more hands-on using cryogen. Initially, I thought this was a negative, but after spending some time hacking away at the default theme and cleaning some rust off css/html skills, I think I have the site looking &lt;i&gt;good enough&lt;/i&gt; for now. As a bonus, I am starting to re-learn web design. However, I am &lt;i&gt;slowly&lt;/i&gt; catching up, so &quot;modern&quot; design features like mobil support might not happen right away. It's not the best looking site, but I has personal touch, which I guess is good in a personal website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's about it. That's why my site suddenly looked different one weekend. If I look forward to using both Clojure and Cryogen more for not only this website, but other personal projects as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;* PS: Re-reading this post I realize trying Cryogen after getting excited about Clojure is VERY much like when I started using org-page after getting excited about emacs. Hopefully this setup is a keeper that I stick with. ;)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Back On Arch, After Frantic Distro-hopping
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks, I have started my CS masters classes, and needed to setup a productive work environment on my portable laptop (&lt;a href='../../homelab'&gt;abra&lt;/a&gt;). Also, while I love Fedora, the Nvidia stuff was being a pain on my main computer (&lt;a href='../../homelab'&gt;alakazam&lt;/a&gt;), and I was looking for a replacement there as well. So, after a long, drawn out battle trying nearly all of my favorite Linux distros, I have found myself once again using &lt;a href='https://www.archlinux.org/'&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt; on both of my personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!&amp;ndash;more&amp;ndash;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;from&amp;#95;fedora...&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From Fedora...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/back-on-arch/fedora-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fedora&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started my journey, I had Fedora on both of my computers. I really like the &lt;a href='https://www.getfedora.org'&gt;Fedora Project&lt;/a&gt; and I think Fedora is a great distribution with a lot of innovative new features. I seems that the Fedora Project is aiming to be the Linux Distro for developers, and I feel that they are really starting to hit that target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one remaining big issue I had while running Fedora on my main computer. Nvidia drivers. They are just a pain to maintain, and kept breaking my system during updates. I know the &lt;a href='http://rpmfusion.org/'&gt;RPM Fusion Repos&lt;/a&gt; are supposed to help, but they just aren't there yet. With my classes starting, I needed something that was a bit more stable (and would hopefully support installing VMWare Workstation 9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;the&amp;#95;'easy&amp;#95;stability'&amp;#95;of&amp;#95;ubuntu-based?&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 'Easy Stability' of Ubuntu-based?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/back-on-arch/ubuntu-mate-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ubuntu Mate&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guided by desires to have a &quot;stable&quot; distro, I decided that the &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; answer would be to use an &lt;a href='http://www.ubuntu.com/'&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;-based distro. So, I went with &lt;a href='https://ubuntu-mate.org/'&gt;Ubuntu Mate&lt;/a&gt;, based on the &lt;i&gt;awesome&lt;/i&gt; work the team has done recently. I've used Ubuntu Mate in the past on several different computers, and in fact, still have it running on &lt;a href='../../homelab/'&gt;charmander&lt;/a&gt;. I had some issues installing Ubuntu Mate on alakazam for some reason, but using a simple &lt;code&gt;nomodeset&lt;/code&gt; at boot seemed work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I got it installed, I was able to install the nvidia drivers, but I had other random issues here and there. I also tried installing VMWare, but had issues at every step. To be completely honest, I really wasn't feeling using an Ubuntu distro on alakazam. If I was going to be replacing Fedora, I wanted to make up for it by using something that gave me more power (I've started to get the itch to try out Gentoo again. Spoiler, I am not using Gentoo. At least until my class is over...). While Ubuntu could easily support my needs being the well supported and advanced distro that it is ... I craved something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;leaping&amp;#95;to&amp;#95;suse?&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Leaping to Suse?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/back-on-arch/opensuse-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenSuse Linux&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my last few months on Fedora, I took notice of another rpm distro that was  making noise in the Linux community: &lt;a href='https://www.opensuse.org/'&gt;OpenSuse&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the new &lt;a href='https://software.opensuse.org/421/en'&gt;OpenSuse Leap&lt;/a&gt; piqued my interest. I had played with it in a VM a few days earlier and liked what I saw. The OpenSuse installer along with the YaST configuration tool makes it &lt;i&gt;stupid easy&lt;/i&gt; to setup powerful and advanced features in Linux. Want to setup a KVM virtualization environment or a samba share? You basically just have to click a button. Testing out &lt;a href='https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Snapper'&gt;Snapper&lt;/a&gt; was also slick. I wish more distributions would start to include tools like snapper, built in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leap was a solid and extensive distribution. Ultimately though, that was the biggest qualm I had with it: there was a lot going on. I did not know what many of the pre-installed configuration tools were. Normally, I am fine with learning new tools, but I wanted a distribution that I could set up and get to work. OpenSuse had &lt;i&gt;too many&lt;/i&gt; &quot;toys&quot; already in it. I would not be able to resist spending hours learning everything. Ironically, my other complaint was that some of the applications I &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; want, were not easily available. Often, they were not included in the default repositories, and while many application websites will provide a &lt;em&gt;.deb download, &lt;/em&gt;.rpms are a bit more scarce. I know there is the wonderful &lt;a href='https://build.opensuse.org/'&gt;openSuse Build Service&lt;/a&gt;, but like &lt;a href='https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/'&gt;Fedora's copr build system&lt;/a&gt;, I often found it to be hit or miss. Both do a good job at addressing a major issue in their respective distributions, but neither isn't quite to the level of ... well, the &lt;a href='https://aur.archlinux.org/'&gt;AUR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;antegeros&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Antegeros&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/back-on-arch/antergos-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Antegeros Linux&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to &lt;a href='https://antergos.com/'&gt;Antergos&lt;/a&gt;. By this point, I was no longer able to hide the fact that I was starting to severely miss many features a distribution like &lt;a href='https://www.archlinux.org/'&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt; provides. I love that you can easily customize just about &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;. I also appreciate that if I want to try something new, 99% of the time the latest version is already in the official repos or the &lt;a href='https://aur.archlinux.org/'&gt;AUR&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, when I am trying a new application, or customizing my setup, the &lt;a href='https://wiki.archlinux.org/'&gt;Arch Wiki&lt;/a&gt; has some of &lt;i&gt;the best documentation&lt;/i&gt; in the Linux ecosystem. However, I wanted something that I could just install and have working. I didn't feel like going through a full vanilla Arch install. So I installed Antergos. Antergos has a simple but thorough installer that pulls down all the latest packages during the installation. This leaves the user with an up-to-date and &lt;i&gt;gorgeous&lt;/i&gt; setup after installation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the &quot;simplicity&quot; of Antergos (which is sort of the antithesis to the definition of &lt;i&gt;simplicity&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;a href='https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux#Simplicity'&gt;The Arch Way&lt;/a&gt;) always seems to bite me in the end. Eventually, &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; breaks, and I have a hard time figuring out &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt;. While it might be a pain to install &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; in vanilla Arch, the user &lt;i&gt;&quot;has a much fuller understanding of his or her system&lt;/i&gt;&quot; as a result. A few years ago, when I first started using Arch, I thought this argument just stupid gray beard nonsense. Now, I appreciate the benefits of this sentiment, and even agree with it (I've also learned to &lt;a href='https://github.com/himmAllRight/dotfiles/blob/master/archInstallScript.sh'&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; my post install process, so it is less of a pain :P).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few days of fighting with Antegeros, I decided to just bite the bullet and install Vanilla Arch. I still think Antegros is a great distribution that works for a bunch of people. It is great for users that want to experience the power of arch Linux, without having to go through all the overhead. Antegeros is actually how I started to learn Arch Linux. Nowadays though, I seem to prefer &lt;i&gt;simplicity&lt;/i&gt; of vanilla Arch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;all&amp;#95;roads&amp;#95;lead&amp;#95;to&amp;#95;arch&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;All Roads Lead to Arch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/back-on-arch/arch-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Arch Linux&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been running Arch on both of my personal laptops for several weeks now. Arch doesn't magically solve all of my issues, but it makes &lt;i&gt;fixing&lt;/i&gt; them much easier. If something isn't working, the combination of the wiki and the community make the problem &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; more approachable. Additionally, the rolling release model appears to mitigate bug-related issues, instead of cause them. For example, I installed Arch on alakazam first, but left Ubuntu Mate on abra (my portable laptop). I did this because my school has a weird network setup that is often difficult to connect to. After searching for hours, I determined that my issues under Ubuntu were caused by a known, but unfixed, bug in my version of network manager. I did not feel like dealing with this, so I installed arch. My internet at school works works fine now. I was able to use the wiki to properly configure my settings, and I was good to go. (Side-note: I never fully got VMWare 9 to work properly on any of my distros, but I came closest with Arch.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/back-on-arch/abra-screen.png&quot; alt=&quot;Abra with Arch and Awesome WM&quot; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Abra running Arch Linux with the &lt;a href='http://awesome.naquadah.org/'&gt;Awesome&lt;/a&gt; window manager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being back on arch has been great. I love using tiling window managers like i3, dwm, xmonad, stumpwm, and awesome. While this this is possible on all distributions, it is much easier on arch. Starting with a blank slate, and (again) having the wiki makes setting up alternative desktop environments and window managers a breeze. I now have a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; productive work environment that is tailored to my needs. While Arch Linux might not be a traditional &quot;stable&quot; distribution, I have found it to be much more durable for my use-case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am planning to stay on Arch for awhile. That being said, I really did enjoy all the other distributions I tried out. Each one seems to be carving out a niche in the Linux environment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fedora is becoming a great distribution for Linux developers. In fact, I still have Fedora 23 (Server Edition) running on my home server. Assuming that the upgrade to 24 goes smoothly (my upgrade from 22 -&gt; 23 went great, thanks to &lt;a href='https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/DNF'&gt;dnf&lt;/a&gt;), I see no reason to switch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenSuse Leap is a solid distribution that is great for power users that want a turn-key distribution with all the bells and whistles. I think it is especially geared toward people with system administration backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu Mate is really the best distribution out there for people that want a classic feeling Linux environment, with a modern flair. It is what Ubuntu would be if it never left gnome 2. It is also great for low resource hardware, particularly boards like the &lt;a href='https://www.raspberrypi.org/'&gt;raspberry pi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antegros is fantastic for Arch users that hate the Arch install. It is also great for people that want to move to Arch, but aren't yet comfortable with tools like pacman.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is great to see all the distributions finally finding their groove. This isn't something I could say about Linux 2 years ago. As I have already stated, I plan to stay on Arch Linux for the time being, but I am very excited to continue trying out the new releases of the all distributions listed above. With so many great options, it really is a great time to be a Linux user :) .&lt;/p&gt;

How I asked my Groomsmen
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months Rebecca (my Fiancee) and I have continued making progress on all the little tasks that we have to complete before our wedding. One of these tasks is asking our intended bridesmaids/groomsmen to be in the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!&amp;ndash;more&amp;ndash;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebecca approached this by asking each of the girls in a way that was somewhat unique to each person, over time. Even though each person was asked differently, all the methods were executed in a very &quot;Rebecca-like&quot; manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I was told that I couldn't simply ask the guys. I had to figure out a &quot;fun&quot; way to ask them, and if possible, to do it in a way that was very &quot;Ryan-like&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;asking&amp;#95;the&amp;#95;groomsmen&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Asking the Groomsmen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Rebecca was slowly chipping away at asking her bridesmaids, we kept failing at finding a way to ask the guys. Finally, one night while driving back north to Massachusetts, I said out of frustration:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;I wish I could just write a stupid piece of code that asks them,  compile it, and give it to them... wait a minute....&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, I started to figure out how I could make it work. The results of that brainstorming session are described below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;snail&amp;#95;mail&amp;#95;part&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Snail Mail Part&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first had to find a way to give the intended groomsmen a link to get any code that I wrote. So, Rebecca and I designed the tri-fold letter pictured below (Sorry for the photo quality).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/how-i-asked-my-groomsmen/ask-message1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The front of the letter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1: The Front of Letter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The front of the envelope had a simple black boarder and said &quot;She said that I had to make it official.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/how-i-asked-my-groomsmen/ask-message2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The first flap of the letter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2: The First Flap of the Letter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the reader flipped up that flap, another message read &quot;So we're doing this my way&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/how-i-asked-my-groomsmen/ask-message-qr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The QR code posted inside the letter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3: The QR Code posted on the Inside of the Letter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, when the reader folded that flap down, they got a taste of what &quot;my way&quot; might entail when the only thing that was printed on the page was a single QR code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the reader scanned the QR code, it opened up a list of instructions on their phone that said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find your computer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href='&quot;http://ryan.himmelwright.net/message/&quot;'&gt;http://ryan.himmelwright.net/message/&lt;/a&gt; and follow the instructions. NO LONGER ACTIVE.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Text Me&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;website&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Website&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the intended groomsmen went to the link provided, they saw a webpage that I made, containing our wedding logo on the bottom right, and a welcome message. The welcome message basically stated that the webpage was not the end of the scavenger hunt, and that they would have to download some code that I compiled, that contained the message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below the welcome message, I had separate instructions that guided Window, Mac, and Linux users, as well as users that wished to compile from source (sort of).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below that I had links to the executable downloads for each operating system mentioned. Lastly, I posted the source code for the code they were downloading, because â¦ you knowâ¦ open source. Executable(s)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the intended groomsmen ran the compiled code (source code posted below), it showed them that it was &quot;decrypting&quot; their message, and printed the percent complete. After about 20% or so, I confessed that there was no &quot;decrypting&quot; and that each message is decoded when printed. I then proceeded to rant in these &quot;decrypting&quot; messages about how I originally wrote a nice GUI python app, but it was a pain to cross compile, and how I eventually just scrapped it and wrote it in LISP. I also mentioned that if they all ran Linux, it wouldn't of been an issue. When it finally reached 100%, I decided to finally give them the message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source Code for the executable I wrote containing the message. Nothing fancy, but everything hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;;; Used to build the executable
&amp;#40;defun build-exe &amp;#40;exe-src&amp;#41;

It read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; So, putting all jokes and nerdy-ness aside, I do have an important  question to ask. As you are probably aware, Rebecca and I are finally  getting married in September. This is will be a very special &lt;em&gt;DAY&lt;/em&gt; in  my life, and as a very special &lt;em&gt;PERSON&lt;/em&gt; in my life, I would like to  ask:  Will you be one of my groomsmen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 2 days after we mailed out the letters, all of then intended groomsmen had messaged me back, confirming that they would be my groomsmen. I also think they enjoyed my methods of asking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess I was successful in asking everyone in a very &quot;Ryan-like&quot; fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;a href='https://github.com/himmAllRight/groomsmen-ask'&gt;source code repo&lt;/a&gt; for this little project is now publically available on my &lt;a href='https://github.com/himmAllRight'&gt;Github Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

25 Days of C
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;As I continue to learn more and more programming languages, I am somewhat ashamed to admit that I have yet to learn C. However, it is not because I am trying to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!&amp;ndash; more &amp;ndash;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;the&amp;#95;reason&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Reason&lt;/h2&gt;C is one of the top languages I wish to know, and know well. C is the backbone for so much code, especially in the Linux ecosphere that it is almost imperative for one to at least understand it. I keep trying to poke my head into open source projects, and so many of them are built or based on C (especially when looking at projects more at the distro and distro applications level).&lt;p&gt;Also, this spring I will start working on my CS MS degree, and while I think the first course I take will be theory based, I know several other courses that will require it (ex: computer architecture and compilers). Being comfortable with C will allow me to focus on the topics, and not on the syntax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have some experience with C++ from my software engineering course I took during undergrad, but that is about it. My goal however is to understand just plain C, which will hopefully make implementing other C-based languages such as C++ a bit easier. My ultimate goal is to eventually have C be one of my top 3 languages (I'm thinking LISP, C, and maybe python or ruby. I know. I'm old school.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;the&amp;#95;plan&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks, I have set up and started looking at &lt;a href='http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/'&gt;Learn C the Hard Way&lt;/a&gt;. I read the first section or two, but haven't been consistent with working through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that it is December, I thought I should maybe start a new monthly challenge, or even a &quot;12/25 days till something&quot;. I was thinking about things I've been trying to constantly work on the last few months, and C popped into my head. Learn C the Hard Way fits particularly well because it is broken down nicely into small segments that I can maybe commit to being able to finish 1 per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to look ahead a bit to see if this challenge is doable, but i think that as of now, the plan is to try to complete at least 1 (I can work ahead if I want to) segment of the book a day for the month of December. I am also going to allow myself the ability to &quot;pre-cache&quot; segments ahead of time so that I don't have to pull away and work on it during the holidays if I don't want to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think this is a good plan that should allow me to start getting some C experience under my belt. I'll be sure to update in the future with how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;update&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, now that I have made it a good bit through the month, I must admit that I have not adhered to this challenge very strictly. I have done many of the exercises, but I have fallen somewhat behind. Basically, I accomplished a bunch of other things and let this challenge slide. I will continue to work on it, but I haven't been able to keep with with the one exercise per day rate. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
