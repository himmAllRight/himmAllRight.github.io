      <description>I am a 25 year-old back-end software developer working in Walpole MA, at a company that primarily develops in Allegro Common Lisp. I spend most of my days writing LISP code, so naturally, I am also a big fan of emacs and spend my working hours with it full screen (which also helps me forget I&amp;rsquo;m in Windows).
Outside of work, I am an avid Linux user that loves learning about programming (especially functional languages), computers, and open source technologies.</description>
