      <description>This is a page where I maintain the status of the computers in my “Homelab”. I will list my current systems here (potentially with screenshots of my current desktop setup for my workstations).
Computers Ryan (Me) Having recently moved to Durham NC, I built a new standing desk and am slowly putting my space together. So for now &amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t mind the wires :P. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep updating this page as I progress.</description>

      <description>I am a 27 year-old Quality Engineer at Red Hat, living and working in Durham, NC. Previously, I worked at 2Is-Inc as a Back-end Software Developer, creating applications and build systems (mostly in Allegro Common Lisp). Before that, I was a student at Lafayette College, where I majored in Neuroscience and minored in Computer Science.
Outside of work, I am still an enthusiastic Linux user that loves learning about computers, programming languages (especially functional ones), and open source technologies.</description>
