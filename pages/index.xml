      <description>This is a page where I maintain the status of the computers in my “Homelab”. I will list my current systems here (potentially with screenshots of my current desktop setup for my workstations).
Computers Ryan (Me) Having recently moved to Durham NC, I built a new standing desk and am slowly putting my space together. So for now &amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t mind the wires :P. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep updating this page as I progress.</description>

      <description>I am a 26 year-old software developer working at a Walpole, MA based company (although I recently moved to Durham, NC), that heavily utilizes Allegro Common Lisp for its applications. I primarily focus on our back-end build and deployment infrastructure, but as with any small company, I wear many hats and jump around assisting wherever I am needed.
Outside of work, I am an enthusiastic Linux user that loves learning about computers, programming languages (especially functional ones), and open source technologies.</description>
