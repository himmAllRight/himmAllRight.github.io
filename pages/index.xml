      <description>I am a 26 year-old software developer working at a Walpole MA based company (although I recently moved to Durham NC), that heavily utilizes Allegro Common Lisp for its applications. I primarily focus on our back-end build and deployment infrastructure, but as with any small company, I wear many hats and jump around assisting wherever I am needed.
Outside of work, I am an enthusiastic Linux user that loves learning about computers, programming languages (especially functional ones), and open source technologies.</description>
