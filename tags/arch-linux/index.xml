      <title>Trying out snapd on Arch Linux</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/snapd-on-arch/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks I have been listening to all of the buzz about
Ubuntu &amp;ldquo;snaps&amp;rdquo;, but I just recently decided to try this new technology
out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;snapd-install-and-setup&#34;&gt;Snapd Install and Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to install snapd on my small netbook (Abra), which is running Arch
Linux. So, installing snapd was as easy as running:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacaur -S snapd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I use pacaur so that I can install packages from Arch Linux&amp;rsquo;s
main repos, as well as the AUR. However, because snapd has actually
been moved to the community repos, you can install it with vanilla
pacman, without aur support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S snapd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After snapd is installed, it needs to be started. To start the snapd
service, just use systemd:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl start snapd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, If you want to start the snapd service automatically
after a reboot run the command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl enable snapd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-snap&#34;&gt;Using snap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After snapd was installed and running, I started
playing with the snap application. The first thing I should note is
that to the extent of my knowledge, snap has to be run as root (at
least for now). So my commands all start with &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I wanted to find a snap package. This can be done using the
&lt;code&gt;snap find&lt;/code&gt; command as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo snap find package-name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(where &lt;strong&gt;package-name&lt;/strong&gt; is the name of the package to search)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt= &#34;Finding Snaps&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/arch-snaps/snap-find.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like in any standard package manager search, the potential
matches were returned, along with a version number, the developer
name, and a summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snap has several other commands. To see a full list of available snap
commands and a description for each one, just type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo snap help&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Snap Help&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/arch-snaps/snap-help.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;testing-a-snap&#34;&gt;Testing a snap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After learning about the basic snap commands, I wanted to install a
snap to see how well it works. I decided to see if there was a
Telegram snap (I heard there was, so it was a good bet). I ran
&lt;code&gt;sudo snap find telegram&lt;/code&gt;, and a list of my options appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Snap telegram&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/arch-snaps/snap-telegram-install.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I choose the last one, and installed it using the command
&lt;code&gt;sudo snap install telegram-serguisens&lt;/code&gt;. A progress bar tracked the download of
the snap, and then the installation. That was it. To my delight,
within a few seconds the Ubuntu &lt;code&gt;snap&lt;/code&gt; application had downloaded the
telegram snap, and installed it on my &lt;em&gt;arch linux&lt;/em&gt; box, without any issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-only-issue&#34;&gt;My Only Issue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Snap Help&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/arch-snaps/snap-telegram-menu.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; without any issues. The one problem I did have was
after installing the telegram snap, the executable wasn&amp;rsquo;t in my path so
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t start it from my launcher or even a terminal. I think this
was actually because snapd wasn&amp;rsquo;t setup fully. I rebooted my computer
and telegram now launches just fine. The snap is even identified with
its full name (&lt;em&gt;telegram-serguisens&lt;/em&gt;), so I can be sure it is the
actual snap, and not another Telegram install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;thoughts&#34;&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Snap Help&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/arch-snaps/snap-telegram.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the fact that snaps are easy to package and install for
developers and users alike, I think my favorite feature was something
that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even think about prior to trying it out, and I might not
of realized had I installed snapd on another computer&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little computer is low power, and tends to heat up and go crazy
when I install certain packages (particularly ones from the
AUR). Sometimes it is so bad that I have to kill the installation and
forego that application for awhile. Telegram is one of them. I think
this is because the aur build pulls down the telegram .deb package and
then has to extract and compile it in order to install it on
Arch. This little computer doesn&amp;rsquo;t like that. The snap however, seems
to of just download and installed itself. It hardly pegged my CPU at
all. If this is true, snaps might have an additional use-case on weaker
hardware, like my netbook. (yes, I know snaps might have a bigger disk
footprint, but honestly that trade-off is fine with me)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the universal application frameworks are a great idea that is
very much needed on Linux. Snapd is very promising and I look forward
to seeing what it and other solutions have in store for the future of
Linux.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trying Out the Plasma 5 Desktop Environment</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/trying-out-plasma5/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/trying-out-plasma5/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After watching the continued development of the Plasma 5 desktop
environment from a distance, I determined I needed to give it another
try. It was just before version 5.6 was released, and the project
appeared to be finding it&amp;rsquo;s stride. Right up front, I want to come
clean and admit that I have never really liked the KDE/Plasma desktop
environment (more on that below). However, with that said&amp;hellip; I am still
using the plasma desktop on my main computer (months later, and
haven&amp;rsquo;t aborted yet**&amp;hellip;). Here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-history-with-kde-plasma&#34;&gt;My History with KDE/Plasma&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as I said above, &lt;em&gt;I have never really liked KDE (now Plasma)&lt;/em&gt;. In
fact, sometimes I down right &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt; it. It is a great project, and I
&lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to like it. It has so many features and is amazing
for power users. I have tried it again and again, desperately wanting
to be swept off my feet, but it&amp;rsquo;s design always kept me bolted to the
ground. The theming made me feel like I was using a Fisher-Price
operating system (which is ironic, because like I said&amp;hellip; the plasma
desktop is probably one of the best power user environments out
there). The bulky features always made it feel childish. So, with that
said&amp;hellip; I have been using using the Plasma desktop on all of my
personal computers for several months. Here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pros&#34;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The theming has come a long way&lt;/strong&gt;. It no longer looks like a
child&amp;rsquo;s toy. Even the default theme is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; appealing. Also, it
has &lt;em&gt;dark themes&lt;/em&gt;, which I am always a fan of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/plasma-desktop/default-plasma.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Default KDE Plasma 5.6 Desktop&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/plasma-desktop/default-plasma.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I Love the customization.&lt;/strong&gt; I love the level of customization
the plasma desktop allows. I can set transparency, add/remove
panels or widgets, set custom keybindings (very important to me),
and a bunch of other operations very easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/plasma-desktop/settings.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Plasma Settings&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/plasma-desktop/settings.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lets me hide window bars&lt;/strong&gt; One customization I love is the ability
to hide the window bars. I am not a fan of window bars, because I
think they look clunky and just take up space. One feature I like
about many tiling window managers is it is usually very easy to hide
the window bars. However, that isn&amp;rsquo;t always the case in Desktop
Environments, but I was pleased with how easy it was to do it in
Plasma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It Lets me create an awesome-wm environment, but as a full DE&lt;/strong&gt;
Similar to above, I am able to implement some of the features I love
about tiling window managers like awesome and i3, but with the full
desktop environment. In addition to removing window bars, I like to
easily move and resize windows by hitting the meta or alt key and
left/right clicking the windows. Again, in Plasma this was simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love krunner. A lot.&lt;/strong&gt; I like using application launchers, and
krunner looks nice, is lightning fast, and gets the job done. I
didn&amp;rsquo;t really know much about krunner during previous attempts at
using KDE. This was definitely contributor to why I liked it much
more this time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/plasma-desktop/krunner.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Plasma Settings&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/plasma-desktop/krunner.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ability to use old-school animations is fun&lt;/strong&gt; There is not much to say
here. While not very practical, sometimes spinning a desktop cube is
just straight up &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/plasma-desktop/cube.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Desktop Cube&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/plasma-desktop/cube.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast. Even for a full DE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cons&#34;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-monitor support. WTF.&lt;/strong&gt; This was by far the biggest issue I
had. My main computer is a 17&amp;rdquo; laptop that I connect to two 24&amp;rdquo;
displays. However, because it is a indeed a laptop, I sometimes move
it around and be semi-mobile with it. This requires disconnecting the
monitors and going from 1 screen to 3 or vice-versa. Well it turns
out that this is usually a pain in the ass for me in Plasma. First,
I have to configure the monitors one-by-one, hitting &amp;ldquo;apply&amp;rdquo; between
each configuration (it doesn&amp;rsquo;t like when I try to move and place all
3 displays in one swoop). Second, once I setup the screen placement,
the panels often go crazy and can&amp;rsquo;t be found, or I have to play
with them to set them up correctly. Lastly, sometimes the displays
overlap each other oddly, even though they appear normal in the
display settings. The wallpapers almost never set correctly and my
right-click menu is disabled on some screens but not
others. Basically, it&amp;rsquo;s just a hot mess and the most infuriating
problem I faced when using Plasma. If I used a laptop without
monitors, or even a permanent desktop setup, I would be
fine. However, that is not my use case.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/plasma-desktop/wtf-multi-monitor.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Plasma Settings&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/plasma-desktop/wtf-multi-monitor.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Randomly just stops working&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes, KDE applications just
crash and I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get them back. Widgets seemed to beak
things more frequently, so I just stopped using them. (Again, not a
good solution)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A full DE&lt;/strong&gt; While I said above that it was nice having an
environment that resembled a window manager, but had the benefit of
the full suite of applications that come with a desktop environment,
sometimes it was also a pain. There&amp;rsquo;s just a lot of crap that I
don&amp;rsquo;t use. The obvious reminder of this was when I would run
&lt;code&gt;pacman -Syu&lt;/code&gt;, and see that the massive KDE stack would need
updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes all the settings can be very confusing&lt;/strong&gt; Having all
these options is great, but sometimes it was
overwhelming. Additionally, the settings felt disjointed and I
didn&amp;rsquo;t know where the settings for some things where.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can finally use Plasma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very fast and lightweight for all that it is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still has a bit of stability/polish work to go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** &lt;i&gt;Update: I took forever to get this post out and I have actually
moved off of Plasma. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle the multi-monitor issues I
had. However, I will definitely be trying out the Desktop Environment
again in the future (I moved to i3-gaps for now. I love my tiling
window managers :) )&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Back On Arch, After Frantic Distro-hopping</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/back-on-arch/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/back-on-arch/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks, I have started my CS masters classes, and needed to setup a productive work environment on my portable laptop (abra). Also, while I love Fedora, the Nvidia stuff was being a pain on my main computer (alakazam), and I was looking for a replacement there as well. So, after a long, drawn out battle trying nearly all of my favorite Linux distros, I have found myself once again using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.archlinux.org/&#34;&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt; on both of my personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;fedora&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-fedora&#34;&gt;From Fedora&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Fedora&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/back-on-arch/fedora-logo.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started my journey, I had Fedora on both of my computers. I really like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://getfedora.org&#34;&gt;Fedora Project&lt;/a&gt; and I think Fedora is a great distribution with a lot of innovative new features. I seems that the Fedora Project is aiming to be the Linux Distro for developers, and I feel that they are really starting to hit that target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one remaining big issue I had while running Fedora on my main computer. Nvidia drivers. They are just a pain to maintain, and kept breaking my system during updates. I know the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rpmfusion.org/&#34;&gt;RPM Fusion Repos&lt;/a&gt; are supposed to help, but they just aren&amp;rsquo;t there yet. With my classes starting, I needed something that was a bit more stable (and would hopefully support installing VMWare Workstation 9).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;ubuntu&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-easy-stability-of-ubuntu-based&#34;&gt;The &amp;lsquo;Easy Stability&amp;rsquo; of Ubuntu-based?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Ubuntu Mate&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/back-on-arch/ubuntu-mate-logo.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guided by desires to have a &amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; distro, I decided that the &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; answer would be to use an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubuntu.com/&#34;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;-based distro. So, I went with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ubuntu-mate.org/&#34;&gt;Ubuntu Mate&lt;/a&gt;, based on the &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; work the team has done recently. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Ubuntu Mate in the past on several different computers, and in fact, still have it running on (charmander). I had some issues installing Ubuntu Mate on alakazam for some reason, but using a simple &lt;code&gt;nomodeset&lt;/code&gt; at boot seemed work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I got it installed, I was able to install the nvidia drivers, but I had other random issues here and there. I also tried installing VMWare, but had issues at every step. To be completely honest, I really wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling using an Ubuntu distro on alakazam. If I was going to be replacing Fedora, I wanted to make up for it by using something that gave me more power (I&amp;rsquo;ve started to get the itch to try out Gentoo again. Spoiler, I am not using Gentoo. At least until my class is over&amp;hellip;). While Ubuntu could easily support my needs being the well supported and advanced distro that it is &amp;hellip; I craved something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;opensuse&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;leaping-to-suse&#34;&gt;Leaping to Suse?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;OpenSuse Linux&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/back-on-arch/opensuse-logo.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my last few months on Fedora, I took notice of another rpm distro that was  making noise in the Linux community: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opensuse.org/&#34;&gt;OpenSuse&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://software.opensuse.org/421/en&#34;&gt;OpenSuse Leap&lt;/a&gt; piqued my interest. I had played with it in a VM a few days earlier and liked what I saw. The OpenSuse installer along with the YaST configuration tool makes it &lt;em&gt;stupid easy&lt;/em&gt; to setup powerful and advanced features in Linux. Want to setup a KVM virtualization environment or a samba share? You basically just have to click a button. Testing out &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Snapper&#34;&gt;Snapper&lt;/a&gt; was also slick. I wish more distributions would start to include tools like snapper, built in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leap was a solid and extensive distribution. Ultimately though, that was the biggest qualm I had with it: there was a lot going on. I did not know what many of the pre-installed configuration tools were. Normally, I am fine with learning new tools, but I wanted a distribution that I could set up and get to work. OpenSuse had &lt;em&gt;too many&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;toys&amp;rdquo; already in it. I would not be able to resist spending hours learning everything. Ironically, my other complaint was that some of the applications I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; want, were not easily available. Often, they were not included in the default repositories, and while many application websites will provide a *.deb download, *.rpms are a bit more scarce. I know there is the wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;https://build.opensuse.org/&#34;&gt;openSuse Build Service&lt;/a&gt;, but like &lt;a href=&#34;https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/&#34;&gt;Fedora&amp;rsquo;s copr build system&lt;/a&gt;, I often found it to be hit or miss. Both do a good job at addressing a major issue in their respective distributions, but neither isn&amp;rsquo;t quite to the level of &amp;hellip; well, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aur.archlinux.org/&#34;&gt;AUR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;antegeros&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;antegeros&#34;&gt;Antegeros&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Antegeros Linux&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/back-on-arch/antergos-logo.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to &lt;a href=&#34;https://antergos.com/&#34;&gt;Antergos&lt;/a&gt;. By this point, I was no longer able to hide the fact that I was starting to severely miss many features a distribution like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.archlinux.org/&#34;&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt; provides. I love that you can easily customize just about &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. I also appreciate that if I want to try something new, 99% of the time the latest version is already in the official repos or the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aur.archlinux.org/&#34;&gt;AUR&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, when I am trying a new application, or customizing my setup, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/&#34;&gt;Arch Wiki&lt;/a&gt; has some of &lt;em&gt;the best documentation&lt;/em&gt; in the Linux ecosystem. However, I wanted something that I could just install and have working. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like going through a full vanilla Arch install. So I installed Antergos. Antergos has a simple but thorough installer that pulls down all the latest packages during the installation. This leaves the user with an up-to-date and &lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt; setup after installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the &amp;ldquo;simplicity&amp;rdquo; of Antergos (which is sort of the antithesis to the definition of &lt;em&gt;simplicity&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux#Simplicity&#34;&gt;The Arch Way&lt;/a&gt;) always seems to bite me in the end. Eventually, &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; breaks, and I have a hard time figuring out &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;. While it might be a pain to install &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; in vanilla Arch, the user &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;has a much fuller understanding of his or her system&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; as a result. A few years ago, when I first started using Arch, I thought this argument just stupid gray beard nonsense. Now, I appreciate the benefits of this sentiment, and even agree with it (I&amp;rsquo;ve also learned to script my post install process, so it is less of a pain :P).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few days of fighting with Antegeros, I decided to just bite the bullet and install Vanilla Arch. I still think Antegros is a great distribution that works for a bunch of people. It is great for users that want to experience the power of arch Linux, without having to go through all the overhead. Antegeros is actually how I started to learn Arch Linux. Nowadays though, I seem to prefer &lt;em&gt;simplicity&lt;/em&gt; of vanilla Arch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;arch&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;all-roads-lead-to-arch&#34;&gt;All Roads Lead to Arch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Arch Linux&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/back-on-arch/arch-logo.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been running Arch on both of my personal laptops for several weeks now. Arch doesn&amp;rsquo;t magically solve all of my issues, but it makes &lt;em&gt;fixing&lt;/em&gt; them much easier. If something isn&amp;rsquo;t working, the combination of the wiki and the community make the problem &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more approachable. Additionally, the rolling release model appears to mitigate bug-related issues, instead of cause them. For example, I installed Arch on alakazam first, but left Ubuntu Mate on abra (my portable laptop). I did this because my school has a weird network setup that is often difficult to connect to. After searching for hours, I determined that my issues under Ubuntu were caused by a known, but unfixed, bug in my version of network manager. I did not feel like dealing with this, so I installed arch. My internet at school works works fine now. I was able to use the wiki to properly configure my settings, and I was good to go. (Side-note: I never fully got VMWare 9 to work properly on any of my distros, but I came closest with Arch.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;../../img/posts/back-on-arch/abra-screen.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Abra with Arch and Awesome WM&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/back-on-arch/abra-screen.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Abra running Arch Linux with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://awesome.naquadah.org/&#34;&gt;Awesome&lt;/a&gt; window manager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being back on arch has been great. I love using tiling window managers like i3, dwm, xmonad, stumpwm, and awesome. While this this is possible on all distributions, it is much easier on arch. Starting with a blank slate, and (again) having the wiki makes setting up alternative desktop environments and window managers a breeze. I now have a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; productive work environment that is tailored to my needs. While Arch Linux might not be a traditional &amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; distribution, I have found it to be much more durable for my use-case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am planning to stay on Arch for awhile. That being said, I really did enjoy all the other distributions I tried out. Each one seems to be carving out a niche in the Linux environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fedora is becoming a great distribution for Linux developers. In fact, I still have Fedora 23 (Server Edition) running on my home server. Assuming that the upgrade to 24 goes smoothly (my upgrade from 22 -&amp;gt; 23 went great, thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/DNF&#34;&gt;dnf&lt;/a&gt;), I see no reason to switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenSuse Leap is a solid distribution that is great for power users that want a turn-key distribution with all the bells and whistles. I think it is especially geared toward people with system administration backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu Mate is really the best distribution out there for people that want a classic feeling Linux environment, with a modern flair. It is what Ubuntu would be if it never left gnome 2. It is also great for low resource hardware, particularly boards like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raspberrypi.org/&#34;&gt;raspberry pi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antegros is fantastic for Arch users that hate the Arch install. It is also great for people that want to move to Arch, but aren&amp;rsquo;t yet comfortable with tools like pacman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is great to see all the distributions finally finding their groove. This isn&amp;rsquo;t something I could say about Linux 2 years ago. As I have already stated, I plan to stay on Arch Linux for the time being, but I am very excited to continue trying out the new releases of the all distributions listed above. With so many great options, it really is a great time to be a Linux user :) .&lt;/p&gt;</description>
