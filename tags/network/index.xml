      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last few months I have been working more with the open source
automation server, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins.io/&#34;&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;. While digging into
it, I have been thinking of ways to improve my home build
environment. One idea, was to utilize Jenkins to automatically build
and deploy a &amp;ldquo;draft&amp;rdquo; website, so I can stage new posts/website change
on my home network, before publishing it to the &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo;
website. Here is how that idea was Instantiated&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nginx as a Reverse Proxy to Forward Sub-Domains</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, Rebecca and I moved to Durham, North Carolina. As a
result, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to re-setup our home network. In years past, I setup
a virtual machine running &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nginx.com/&#34;&gt;Nginx&lt;/a&gt; as a
reverse-proxy (Tangela), and I decided to do that again on the new
network. While it is a simple process, it is one that other people often
ask me about. So, this time&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m taking notes!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simple Reverse SSH Tunnels</title>

      <description>Last week, I was on vacation with my family. While I didn&amp;rsquo;t work a ton on personal projects, I was at least able to spend some time on my TunelBeacon project again. I will write a dedicated post about that project down the road when I am further along. Basically, it will be a simple GUI to create reverse ssh tunnels, that family and friends can startup in order grant me temporary access to their computer when they need support.</description>

      <title>Encountered Issues Setting Up Ubiquiti Network</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/issues-setting-up-ubiquiti-network/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past weekend, I setup my new ubiquiti network. It actually took up a good
portion of Sunday, because I ran into a few minor issues.
Fortunately/Unfortunately, these issues were mostly because it my first time
configuring this type of setup, and there was a lot of trial and error. The basic
network is now all configured and has been running great. It was a good day and I
learned a lot :). In fact, I am confident that if I had to start over from
scratch, the process would take me about 10-15 minutes. Just to be sure, I&amp;rsquo;m
 going to quickly jot down the major pain points I experienced my first time around.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Home Network Ubiquiti Upgrade</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I went back to Pennsylvania for a week to attend my college swim
team reunion, and my brother&amp;rsquo;s high school graduation. While I was away, the
wifi-router Rebecca and I were using decided to die (of course). When I returned, I
setup our old router as a &lt;em&gt;temporary&lt;/em&gt; fix. It was terrible. So, I began
researching how I should upgrade our network. This time around, I am doing this
&lt;em&gt;correctly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
