      <description>While I have loved using Cryogen to create this website for over a year and a half now, I have started the transition to using another static website generator. Specifically, I have been experimenting with Hugo. This post will detail why I am switching, what I have ported over thus far, and what still needs to be completed before generating the official site with hugo.
From Cryogen to Hugo My departure from Cryogen really has nothing to do with the project itself.</description>
