      <title> Upgrading My iPad Pro</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/getting-an-ipad/&#34;&gt;I purchased my first iPad&lt;/a&gt;, a 10.5&amp;rdquo;
iPad Pro. I use it just about every day. With the release of the newest 2021
iPad Pro, I decided it was finally time to trade mine in for an upgrade. Here&amp;rsquo;s
why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/upgrading-ipad-pro-2021/10.5_pro_box.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The box of my 10.5 iPad Pro&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/upgrading-ipad-pro-2021/10.5_pro_box.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The box of my 10.5&amp;rdquo; iPad Pro&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got my 10.5&amp;rdquo; iPad Pro, the 2018 11&amp;rdquo; iPad Pro had already been released.
At the time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think the extra features justified the increased
price of the new iPad. The discount price on the &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; pro was more appealing to
me. I was already upselling myself, after originally looking into the base
(non-pro) iPad, so the discounted 10.5&amp;rdquo; seemed like a good compromise between
features and price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10.5&amp;rdquo; pro was a good starting point for my first iPad. It was a great
device, but not too over the top in case I ended up not using it much. If I
&lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; use it, I could always upgrade/swap it out in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-upgrade&#34;&gt;Why upgrade?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/upgrading-ipad-pro-2021/apple_pencil_tall.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Apple Pencil&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/upgrading-ipad-pro-2021/apple_pencil_tall.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; width: 250px; float: right;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having my ipad for several months, I started to understand how the
improved features of the 2018 pro could be nice to have. In particular, the
USB-C port, smaller bezels, and FaceID were all very appealing to me.  Still, my
10.5&amp;rdquo; suited my needs just fine. I did decide though that I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; likely
upgrade my iPad sometime in the future. I enjoyed having it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the one thing I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; want to add to my iPad: the Apple
Pencil.  Being able to hand draw is a special feature unique to tablet computers
that I cannot easily reproduce on my other devices. It&amp;rsquo;s a foundational reason
to even &lt;em&gt;consider&lt;/em&gt; owning a tablet. Additionally, in the years since I purchased
my iPad, new iPadOS releases have started to polish the use of the &amp;lsquo;magic&amp;rsquo;
pencil with the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my 10.5&amp;rdquo; ipad only supported the 1st generation Apple Pencil.
Knowing that I would &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; upgrade my iPad, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to buy an old
pencil, only to have to &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; replace it when I upgraded. So, I decided to wait
to get the Pencil until it was time to upgrade my device. Now feels like a good
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-this-generation&#34;&gt;Why this generation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/upgrading-ipad-pro-2021/front_camera.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;new ipad pro cameras&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/upgrading-ipad-pro-2021/front_camera.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The 2021 iPad Pro includes a ultra wide front camera, to use with the new center stage feature&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few factors that pushed me to upgrade to &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; generation of the
iPad Pro. First, I can still get a decent trade-in value for it.  Considering
it&amp;rsquo;s been about 4 years since the 10.5&amp;rdquo; model was released, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how
long that value last with my iPad. Second, if I want to trade it in with Apple
(and I do, it&amp;rsquo;s probably the easiest method), I am limited to spending the
credit value in their store. While I could try to get a refurbished device,
there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been many used iPad Pros in stock since the pandemic started. So
the latest model is my best bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond ease of trade-in, there are a few new features in this latest generation
that I am interested in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The M1 chip is complete overkill, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind having one in my iPad
considering how much I love it  &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/m1-air-initial-thoughts/&#34;&gt;my MacBook
Air&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, it provides more
computational overhead (and increased RAM) incase Apple ever decides to finally
push the capabilities of iPadOS further (which they need to do).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I thought it was a bit of a gimmick at first, the wide-angle
front-facing camera paired with the new &amp;ldquo;Center Stage&amp;rdquo; feature on the 2021 iPad
Pro could actually be useful.  My wife and I use FaceTime to video chat with my
family (we live in another state from everyone), and my ipad is usually what we
use to do it. Being able to more easily fit the two of us in frame, and have it
self-adjust as my wife comes and goes would be delightful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, while USB-C is great, Thunderbolt is better. I already have all of my
periphery gear hooked up to a thunderbolt dock to connect my work and personal
laptops to. The increased bandwidth also helps to &amp;ldquo;future proof&amp;rdquo; (again,
assuming Apple can improve the OS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-the-11-over-the-12-9&#34;&gt;Why the 11&amp;rdquo; over the 12.9&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/upgrading-ipad-pro-2021/size_and_weight.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;iPad Pro Size Comparison&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/upgrading-ipad-pro-2021/size_and_weight.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The iPad Pro Size Comparison&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I would think about upgrading my iPad Pro, I always figured I would
switch to a 12.9&amp;rdquo; version. So why then have I instead opted for the 11&amp;rdquo; when the
12.9&amp;rdquo; is clearly the more exciting option this year, having the new &amp;ldquo;Liquid
Retina XDR&amp;rdquo; display? Well, as much as I&amp;rsquo;d enjoy seeing that new display, that
price bump makes it a bit more unreasonable for a feature I &lt;em&gt;truly do not need&lt;/em&gt;.
I don&amp;rsquo;t do any visual work, and the display on the 11&amp;rdquo; Pro is more than enough
for anything I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real reason for the 11&amp;rdquo;, is that I now have a great portable laptop.  I was
previously looking at the bigger ipad to be my travel/portable device, but now
that I have an m1 air, a 12.9&amp;rdquo; ipad with a keyboard would actually weigh &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;.
I want my ipad to be more portable than my mac. As a bonus, if
the combined size and weight remains low, it&amp;rsquo;s easy enough to travel with &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;
devices. For reference, a 11&amp;rdquo; iPad Pro (without a case) and my macbook Air have
a &lt;em&gt;combined weight&lt;/em&gt; of only 3.6 lbs, whereas my previous &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/&#34;&gt;16&amp;rdquo; Macbook
Pro&lt;/a&gt; alone weighed 4.3lbs! I would like to keep this portability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-not-the-new-ipad-air&#34;&gt;Why not the new iPad Air?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/upgrading-ipad-pro-2021/buy_ipad_air_colors.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;iPad Air Colors&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/upgrading-ipad-pro-2021/buy_ipad_air_colors.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The iPad Air Color Options&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if I am contemplating getting the 11&amp;rdquo; iPad Pro, why not consider the
2020 iPad Air? I struggled with this decision for awhile, particularly before
the latest generation pro was announced. In general, I think the air would be
&lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt; and meet all of my needs. The reality is that &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of these devices
are currently overkill for most iPad tasks. &lt;em&gt;With that said&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; I think the
additional features of the 2021 pro are actually worth the $200 difference (in
my case). Here are a few of those feature differences, and my justification for
the pro:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Display&lt;/strong&gt;: I like the 120hz pro-motion display. I read all the time on
my ipad, and I love how smooth it is. In addition, if my plan is to get an Apple
pencil right away, the high refresh rate can help &lt;em&gt;the pencil&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; responsiveness also feel better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(furthermore, while not a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; deal, the screen is a little brighter
on the pro, which is appreciated when I want to read outside)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cameras&lt;/strong&gt;: As I said above, the ultra wide front camera is great for
FaceTime, as it is my FaceTime device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better speakers&lt;/strong&gt;: I love having nice speakers on my systems, especially
my travel devices. I&amp;rsquo;ve already downgraded my laptop speakers going &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/&#34;&gt;from the
16&amp;rdquo; to the m1 air&lt;/a&gt;, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do it
again. (The pro has 4 speakers, whereas the air only has 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FaceID&lt;/strong&gt;: TouchID is great, but my finger tips tend to peel due to
allergies, and FaceID simply works more consistently for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thunderbolt&lt;/strong&gt;: Not a deal breaker, but if I want to play around with testing an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/&#34;&gt;ipad as a modular
computer&lt;/a&gt; at all, I
already have TB3 docks setup to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt;: The base version pro has twice as much storage as the air. I
didn&amp;rsquo;t think this was an issue, but then I looked at the usage on my ipad and
saw I had consumed 60/64GB. I expect my usages will only continue to grow if I
begin to sketch diagrams and notes more often. The air also starts at 64GB,
where the pro begins with 128GB of storage. To upgrade the air, you need to jump
to all the way up to the 256gb hard drive.  After that upgrade, the air is less
than $50 away from the price of the pro.  Considering everything else I listed
above, I think it is definitely worth that additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LiDar&lt;/strong&gt; (seriously 😆): This is more of a novelty than a feature for most
people. Still, as someone that likes to play with AR, uses their iPad to scan
floor plans of their house, or to take rough measurements&amp;hellip; the LiDar would
help the iPad improve all those tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/upgrading-ipad-pro-2021/order_status.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;My ipad pro order status: processing&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/upgrading-ipad-pro-2021/order_status.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;My iPad Pro order status: Processing&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go. Those were &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of my reasons for why I concluded to finally
trade in my 10.5&amp;rdquo; iPad Pro, for a new 11&amp;rdquo; model. I have ordered the 2021
11&amp;rdquo; iPad Pro (in silver), along with an Apple Pencil 2, and selected to trade in
my old one with the purchase. Now, all I can do is wait for it to ship. It&amp;rsquo;s
been stuck
&lt;em&gt;processing&lt;/em&gt; for over a week, but
could &lt;em&gt;arrive&lt;/em&gt; as early as two days ago 😐. Hopefully it ships soon&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2020 M1 Macbook Air Initial Thoughts</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/m1-air-initial-thoughts/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/m1-air-initial-thoughts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As discussed in my &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I decided
to trade-in my 2019 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro and replace it with a new 2020 M1 MacBook
Air. So far, I think making the swap was a terrific idea. Here are
my initial thoughts&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-what-i-ordered&#34;&gt;Background (what I ordered)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/m1_air_box.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The M1 Air Box&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/m1_air_box.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The MacBook Air Box&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, I got the &amp;lsquo;second tier&amp;rsquo; 2020 M1 MacBook Air (Silver, 8 gpu
cores, 512GB ssd) and upgraded the RAM to 16Gb. I wanted to maintain the same
RAM and storage that my MBP had. After an eternity (3+ weeks), the air
was delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-like&#34;&gt;What I Like&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/side.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The M1 Air Side&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/side.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Side of the MacBook Air&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, lets start with the good. There is a lot to say here, but these are my
main thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s cool and &lt;del&gt;quiet&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;silent&lt;/em&gt;. It hardly heats up, and when
it does, it is &lt;em&gt;barely&lt;/em&gt; noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is very portable. I can easily pick it up with one hand, and set it on my
lap nearly anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like having physical function keys again. I even learned
how to utilize &lt;a href=&#34;https://folivora.ai&#34;&gt;BetterTouchTool&lt;/a&gt; for window management
using keyboard shortcuts, instead of the touch bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;video style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; controls&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/wake_compare.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;movie.ogg&#34; type=&#34;video/ogg&#34;&gt;
Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The instant wake is nicer than I thought it would be&lt;/id&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instant wake is actually delightful. I initially thought my sleep settings
were misconfigured, and that the laptop wasn&amp;rsquo;t turning off when I shut
the lid. It&amp;rsquo;s a feature that I thought &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;who cares&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; when it was announced, but
after I tried it, my 16&amp;rdquo; suddenly felt unbearably slow for the few days I had
both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosetta II is amazing at what it does. Most apps just work because of it,
even if they haven&amp;rsquo;t been ported to Apple Silicon yet. This has made the transition
rather seamless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works surprisingly well at my desk on the laptop stand, possibly even
better than the 16&amp;rdquo;. The laptop is about the same size as the stand, so I&amp;rsquo;m
able to push it further back, out of the way, and it is much sturdier. The
smaller screen hasn&amp;rsquo;t been an issue with the content I usually play on it at
my desk (background videos or music). With how cool it runs, I also feel
safer closing it to focus solely on my external monitor, as if I was using a
mac mini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;video style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; controls&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/terminal_compare.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;movie.ogg&#34; type=&#34;video/ogg&#34;&gt;
Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;New tabs in my terminal lagged for some reason on the MBP. Not on the Air.&lt;id&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My terminal instantly opens! For some reason on my mac, it always took
a second to load the shell prompt in iterm with my config. On the air,
it is instant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garage band works much better. It opens immediately and is ready. My 16&amp;rdquo;
would freeze while loading, then sometimes beach-ball and crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battery life is great. I don&amp;rsquo;t really think about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-could-be-better&#34;&gt;What Could be Better&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/macbooks_compare.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;My old MacBook Pro and the new M1 Air&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/macbooks_compare.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Air has thicker bezels compared to my old 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screen bezels are rather thick, even compared to the 16&amp;rdquo; and could use
some slimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More TB ports. The air has two Thunderbolt ports, on only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; side of the
laptop. I use hubs, so I don&amp;rsquo;t usually require more than the two ports, but
it can be an issue to only have them on one side depending on where I want to
place my laptop. Having one port on either side wouldn&amp;rsquo;t solve the issue
either, because I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like wrapping the power cord all the way around to
the other port when my hub is plugged in. The only &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; solution is to have
more than 2 TB ports, split across both sides of the laptop, &lt;em&gt;even if&lt;/em&gt; you
don&amp;rsquo;t need them all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some applications are still tricky to install. For example, I had to
compile &lt;code&gt;neofetch&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;homebrew&lt;/code&gt; (which was simple enough to do). I imagine
this issue should resolve with time. Overall though, I haven&amp;rsquo;t really had any
major installation issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-s-different&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; Different?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/keyboard.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The M1 Air Keyboard&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/keyboard.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The MacBook Air does not have a touchbar&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few things that were neither good nor bad, just &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; coming
from an Intel 16&amp;rdquo; MBP:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, not having the touch bar. Not that I &lt;em&gt;miss&lt;/em&gt; it, but I
apparently got used to checking the time there and had to slowly break that
habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Efficiency cores are weird at first. I would look at my CPU usage when
only running background tasks and wonder why the first four cores had such
high usage, especially when compared to the other four. Eventually, I
realized it was because the tasks were running using mostly the efficiency
cores. So while it &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; like there was a heavy load that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t being
properly balanced across the cores&amp;hellip; the work was actually shifted to be
more efficient. This is the desired functionality, but weird to get used to
at first if you&amp;rsquo;re someone that is constantly watching CPU usage like I do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smaller screen space. I got used to the smaller screen quicker than I
anticipated, and I think the trade-off is worth it for the portability of
this laptop. But it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speakers. The air has &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; speakers&amp;hellip; but the 16&amp;rdquo;
had &lt;em&gt;truely amazing&lt;/em&gt; speakers. Like the screen resolution, this is mostly a physical
size limitation, and I think the trade-off is well worth it here as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/laptop_coffee.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The M1 Air with Coffee&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/laptop_coffee.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The MacBook Air with my coffee&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This laptop has been remarkable. It reminds me of some of my previous
&lt;em&gt;portable&lt;/em&gt; laptops, like the x230 thinkpad and my x201e. That is a good thing.
I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; both of those computers and their ability to be thrown in a bag on
the go. It is a setup that pairs nicely with a powerful workstation, which &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/selecting-charmeleons-upgrades/&#34;&gt;I
currently have&lt;/a&gt;. While the air has
about the same footprint as both of those previous laptops, it is thinner,
lighter, has more screen space, and is
&lt;em&gt;magnitudes&lt;/em&gt; more powerful. I can&amp;rsquo;t complain with that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Traded my 2019 16&#34; MacBook Pro for a M1 MacBook Air</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over a year has passed since I purchased a &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/&#34;&gt;base model 2019 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook
Pro&lt;/a&gt;. My first Mac. With it&amp;rsquo;s large &amp;ldquo;retina&amp;rdquo;
display, resurrected magic keyboard, and truly &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; speakers, it might
be the most pleasurable laptop I have ever owned. However, I decided to trade
it in&amp;hellip; for a new MacBook &lt;em&gt;air&lt;/em&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mac_challenge.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Installing macOS Cataline on old air&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mac_challenge.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Installing macOS Catalina on my wife&amp;rsquo;s old MacBook Air for my Mac challenge&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Fall of 2019, I decided to do a &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/macos-challenge/&#34;&gt;30 day macOS&lt;/a&gt;
challenge. During the challenge, I learned that while I think Linux is still
my go-to and &lt;em&gt;indispensable&lt;/em&gt; OS, I did enjoy having a mac available for doing
more &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKiAnxjM8Nc&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;normal life computing&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.
Web browsing, writing emails, managing calendars, personal finance, planning
home projects with my wife, ssh&amp;rsquo;ing into servers to code&amp;hellip; that type of
stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the challenge, I decided to acquire a mac for myself. I choose the 16&amp;rdquo;
MBP &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; because it was the only MacBook at the time with the new magic
keyboard. That was a hard requirement I had. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even consider buying
a butterfly MacBook. Keyboard aside, as my &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; Mac, I did want it
to be powerful enough to be my &amp;lsquo;workstation&amp;rsquo; mac/laptop. And it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_cooling.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;the mbp had better cooling&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_cooling.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;While the 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro did improve cooling compared to it&amp;rsquo;s predecessor, it was still too warm for my tastes&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few months of use, a problem emerged regarding that power&amp;hellip; I didn&amp;rsquo;t utilize it. As I discovered
&lt;a href=&#34;../../post/sold-my-bonobo/&#34;&gt;the last time I had a more &amp;ldquo;workstation laptop&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, I
don&amp;rsquo;t like when my computers overheat and spin up their fans. The 16&amp;rdquo; macbook
was relatively thin for its specs (did you see the size of
my previous workstaion laptop!?!?). However, that sleek design came at a
cost. While the re-designed cooling on the 16&amp;rdquo; was considered quite good for
a MacBook&amp;hellip; it didn&amp;rsquo;t meet my standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_photoimport_turboboost.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Importing photos, turbo boost made temps 100c&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_photoimport_turboboost.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;While using the CPU (importing photos), the temps stayed at 80C with turbo boost disabled. After enabling it, the temps shot up to 100C!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually purchased and installed &lt;a href=&#34;http://tbswitcher.rugarciap.com&#34;&gt;turbo boost
switcher&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;em&gt;disable turbo boost on my
cpu&lt;/em&gt; This runs the cpu at it&amp;rsquo;s base clock, without boosting it up for more
&amp;lsquo;bursty&amp;rsquo; performance. This didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to hinder my small day-to-day usage,
and in my mind, was more than worth the trade to keep the computer a little
bit cooler, and prevent the fans from spinning up all the time. It was just a
shame to pay so much money for such powerful computer&amp;hellip; and then
purposefully hinder it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-m1-macs-are-released&#34;&gt;The M1 Macs are Released&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/m1_released.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Apple&#39;s M1 Announcement&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/m1_released.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Apple announced it&amp;rsquo;s first Apple Silicon CPU, the M1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in November, Apple announced the new M1 Macs, the first
computers in the company&amp;rsquo;s planned 2 transition to switch from Intel CPUs to
Apple&amp;rsquo;s own &amp;ldquo;Apple Silicon&amp;rdquo; arm processors. And they were a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was skeptical about the smoothness of a cpu architecture switch, early
reviewers indicated that Apple handled it extremely well. This had me
tempted to immediately swap my MBP in for one of the newer ones. But, I decided to
hold out for a bit, reasoning that my 16&amp;rdquo; computer was still an &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;
laptop that was more than capable of what I needed it for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the seed of questioning &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I use a mac had been planted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-use-a-mac&#34;&gt;How I use a Mac&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to map out my Mac use-cases in two broad categories: &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; I
use my mac for, and &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; I use it. After some brainstorming, I had the
following lists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-i-use-a-mac-for&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; I use a Mac For&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I most commonly use my Mac for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilizing Apple apps and services (Messages, FaceTime, Notes, Reminders,
Photos, GarageBand, Music, iCloud, Etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Browsing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Courses/Proctored Exams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH and/or VS Code (I do coding, writing, and all those other tasks on my workstation, and remote in when on my MacBook)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Planning/organizing, emails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to podcasts or music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching videos or livestreams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chatting with Friends and Family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt; a light game if I&amp;rsquo;m on the go or not at my desk (possibly streamed from my gaming VM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;where-i-use-a-macbook&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where&lt;/em&gt; I use a MacBook&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/macbook_stand.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Macbook on a stand&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/macbook_stand.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;As my main laptop, my MacBook occasionally has to serve as my portable workstation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being both my &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; Mac, as well as my main portable computer, there is
actually quite a range of &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I setup my MacBook. Some examples
include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portable: I use it as my portable machine, in a few types of locations:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sitting on the couch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At a Table, by itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At a table on a stand w/ Keyboard, and possibly other external displays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As my single portable workstation if I travel or visit family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As my Mac &amp;lsquo;desktop&amp;rsquo;, connected to all the devices at my desk via a thunderbolt hub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;best-tool-for-the-job&#34;&gt;Best Tool for the Job&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/desktop_benchmarking.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Using my macbook while running benchmarks on my desktop&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/desktop_benchmarking.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Using my MBP while running benchmarks on my desktop
after &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../post/selecting-charmeleons-upgrades/&#34;&gt;some upgrades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Dispite
its pwer, my Mac is a &lt;em&gt;secondary&lt;/em&gt; computer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A disparity stood out to me while makings these lists. I
generally try to use appropriate hardware for my need (at least within
reason). Looking over what I wrote, it felt weird to have a $2000+ laptop for
what I use it for. I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; need that much for my &lt;em&gt;secondary computer&lt;/em&gt;,
even if I loved the speakers and screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this was my &lt;em&gt;main&lt;/em&gt; computer, it would be fine. But it isn&amp;rsquo;t. I have a
&lt;a href=&#34;../../post/selecting-charmeleons-upgrades/&#34;&gt;powerful linux workstation&lt;/a&gt; for my
heavy lifting and complicated, virtual workloads. Hell, macOS isn&amp;rsquo;t even my
main OS. I do all my power-user computing on Linux&amp;hellip; even if it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; my
mac (as previously stated, I &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; into my desktop for nearly everything&amp;hellip;
including writing these posts). The MBP &lt;em&gt;met&lt;/em&gt; the role I needed it for, but
it didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily
&lt;em&gt;fit&lt;/em&gt; that role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;16-mbp-vs-air&#34;&gt;16&amp;rdquo; MBP vs. Air&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/both_macs_closed.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Both Macs, closed on table&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/both_macs_closed.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The 2019 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro and the 2020 M1 Macbook Air&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hammering out my MacBook use cases, I theorized how a M1 MacBook Air
might compare to my 16&amp;rdquo; MBP in meeting those needs. I came up with the following
conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I do occasionally use some of the mac&amp;rsquo;s heavier software (garageband,
imovie, Photos, and others), the performance of the M1 is more than enough
for what I would need it to do, and even &lt;em&gt;beats&lt;/em&gt; my Intel MBP on some tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t benefit me to wait for more powerful Apple Silicon Macs,
as my needs are already passed for what I need this device to do. Even
if an Apple Silicon 16&amp;rdquo; MBP &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; available, tempting as it might be, I&amp;rsquo;ve
already established it isn&amp;rsquo;t a good fit for this device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I would miss the screen space and speakers, the air would be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;
more portable. Not only would this be great when traveling, but it would also
be appreciated when picking it up with one hand to take into another room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dedicated GPU in the MBP doesn&amp;rsquo;t really benefit me, as I do all my
gaming in a Windows VM on my workstation. In fact, it may actually &lt;em&gt;hurt&lt;/em&gt; my
experience by generating excess heat and kicking up the fans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And on that note&amp;hellip; the air doesn&amp;rsquo;t even &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; a fan to spin up, and
doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to get too warm either. Unlike the M1 MBP, it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; throttle
to cool the CPU during sustained workloads, but we&amp;rsquo;ve already established
that I am &lt;em&gt;currently&lt;/em&gt; doing that on my 16&amp;rdquo; anyway ☺︎.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I concluded that the Air should be able to do most of the tasks my
16&amp;rdquo; MBP does, at around the same level of perfomrance, if not better. In the
case of portability and noise, the air would be &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; better suited than
my Pro. Additionally, most of the workloads the MBP &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; better at,
aren&amp;rsquo;t as important for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;decided-to-go-for-it&#34;&gt;Decided to Go for it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/trade-in-value.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Current trade-in-value&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/trade-in-value.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;I knew my trade-in value would only get worse, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to wait for the new 16&amp;rdquo; Pro to come out&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I decided to make the trade-in. My main reasons were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current trade-in price would cover the cost of the &amp;ldquo;higher end&amp;rdquo; M1
Macbook Air, and I would only have to pay tax and for any other updgrades I
wanted to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew I would slowly get less and less for my MBP. I figured once a new
16&amp;rdquo; MBP was released, the value for mine would likely plummet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I ordered the higher tier Air ( with 8gpu cores + 512GB of storage),
and bumped up the RAM to 16GB. If I was going to be be &amp;ldquo;downgrading&amp;rdquo;
from a MBP to an Air, I wanted to at least keep the same amount of RAM and
storage that I had before. It took almost a month to arrive, but now it&amp;rsquo;s
here, and I&amp;rsquo;m packing up the MBP to send back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need this secondary computer to function as my portable laptop, and only
(physical) Mac. I think the m1 air will fill both of these roles extremely
well. If I needed a laptop to be my &lt;em&gt;main&lt;/em&gt; machine&amp;hellip; I would have probably
kept the MBP and upgrade after a newer Apple Silicon version is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp16.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;My mbp.&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp16.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;My old 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2019 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro was, and still is, an amazing machine. I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; miss
it. Ultimately though, a combination of the M1 Macs being &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good, and
the fact that a smaller, thin and light laptop fit my use case best,
finalized my decision to switch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My New 16-inch Macbook Pro: Initial Thoughts</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/macos-challenge/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I &lt;em&gt;mentioned&lt;/em&gt; that I had
purchased a new 2019 16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro by the end of my macOS challenge.  I have
had the laptop for over a month now, but I made sure to take notes on some of
my initial thoughts during the first few days. Here are those thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;selection&#34;&gt;Selection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, &lt;em&gt;a word from our sponsor!&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; Just kidding. However, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to
take a minute to talk about how I selected &lt;em&gt;my first&lt;/em&gt; macbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-desk-website.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;MBP on my desk&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-desk-website.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;New 16&amp;rdquo; MBP on my desk&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While completing the macOS challenge, I decided I wanted to buy a
macbook for personal use. However, I wanted to hold out and wait to hear if the
rumors of a new scissor-switch macbook pro were true, or if I
should be considering a used 2015 Macbook Pro on eBay. Fortunately, the rumor
turned to fact, and Apple released the new 16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro. This news coupled
with a $300-off, Thanksgiving (US) sale, meant that I had a new macbook
shipping to me the first week of December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-base-model-specs&#34;&gt;The Base Model Specs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-closed.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Macbook Pro closed on the table&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-closed.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro closed on the table&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose the base-spec MBP (the cheapest one) for several reasons. First, it
saved me a bunch of money because 1) Apple upgrades tend to be expensive, and 2)
the base models can be found on sale more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the &amp;ldquo;low-end&amp;rdquo; base model specs of the 16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro were
increased to include 16 GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. This meant that it already
had everything I would normally &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to upgrade. So, the specs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- 2.6 GHz (4.5 GHz Turbo Boost) 6-Core (12 thread) i7 CPU
- 16 GB 2666MHz DDR4 RAM
- 512 GB SS
- 16&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Retina&amp;#34; display w/ True Tone
- New Keyboard design, with touchbar and Touch ID
- Four Thunderbold 3 ports
- Headphone Jack
- New speakers and mic
- Silver&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have wanted 32 GB of RAM. But if I think
about it, I &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; need RAM to run clusters of VMs&amp;hellip; which I do on Linux
workstation/servers&amp;hellip; not my laptop. So 16GB should be plenty for the needs of
&lt;em&gt;this machine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-thoughts&#34;&gt;Initial Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, now lets get to my initial thoughts. Remember, these are the
(reformatted) notes I took within about a day or so of receiving the Macbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-keyboard.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Macbook Pro from above&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-keyboard.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;I love both the new keyboard and speakers on the 16&amp;rdquo;
Macbook Pro&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keyboard&lt;/strong&gt; - Well, I’m surprised. I think I actually &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like it. The
first few minutes were a little weird, because I was used to the (2014) MacBook
Air (Also, I had been using &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-hhkb-pro2/&#34;&gt;my
HHKB&lt;/a&gt; all day). After using
it for about an hour now, I think it feels close to the air (which I like),
with &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; travel. It definitely does not have as much travel as my
Thinkpads, but it is acceptable. The keys feel like they “pop” as I type on
them, with a very satisfying bump. Overall, I very much enjoy the typing
experience. As long as it proves to be sturdy and reliable, I’d say this is
a great laptop keyboard. I am very happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trackpad&lt;/strong&gt; - Little weird at first (I had trouble sliding my fingers across
it.  I guess I needed time to oil it a bit lol), but now it seems to be working
well. It is massive, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to register accidental touches much.
Really, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much to say. It does what I need it to, basically &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the
time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen&lt;/strong&gt; - Wonderful. It’s big, bright and the colors look great. Using
the default scaling still, but actually think it’s big enough. It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful
screen large enough to get work done, on a still small-ish laptop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touch Bar&lt;/strong&gt; - Meh. It&amp;rsquo;s whatever. I have already installed better touch tool
😂. I’ll play with that later to figure out how I can switch the
audio/brightness to buttons instead of slides (the main thing I don’t like so
far), and maybe add weather. In summary, with better touch tool, I don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;mind&lt;/em&gt;
having the touch bar, but probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t miss it much if it was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt; - Amazing. Simple as that. They aren&amp;rsquo;t going to replace a
high-end pair of studio monitors, but are probably the best laptop speakers out
there, and likely better than most cheap desktop ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ports&lt;/strong&gt; - Just charging so far. I like being able to charge on
both sides. Side note: the power brick feels like an &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; brick. It is
solid and heavy, which is fine, but did surprise me a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt; - As far as I can tell, great. It seems like it can handle
most of the work loads &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; will need it for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;issues-annoyances-concerns&#34;&gt;Issues/Annoyances/Concerns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-side.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Macbook Pro from side&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-side.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;As for ports, the 16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro has two USB C/Thunderbolt3 ports and a headphone jack on one side (pictured), and 2 more USB C/Thunderbolt3 ports on the other side.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heat&lt;/strong&gt; - As I’m typing this, I do notice the metal at the top of the laptop
(above the Touch Bar) is getting quite toasty. In fact, the keys on the number
row are even a bit warm. I understand that this is where the heat is exhausted,
and that the cooling system probably relies on the aluminum body a bit as a
heat sink. I just hope it’s normal. I should note that this heat up happened
while I was installing Xcode&amp;hellip; which seems to be a beast. Once Xcode finished
installing, it did cool down fast. The entire time, the palm rest remained nice
and cool to the touch. Also, the fans never kicked up for this. So it seems
that the cooling system is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good on this laptop. I just wish it would
kick in a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bit sooner to prevent it from heating up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ports/Adaptor Annoyances&lt;/strong&gt; - Everyone is complaining that there still isn&amp;rsquo;t
an SD card reader, but honestly I could care less. I generally think having
powerful TB3 ports is a good plan, as it allows the user to craft their system
to have whatever ports &lt;em&gt;they need&lt;/em&gt;. For example, I &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; usually need an SD
card reader, but I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use USB3 and HDMI daily. With a dongle/adaptor, I can
have that, and the TB3 connector has enough bandwidth to support it. However, the
annoying part is buying into the TB3 life. I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to buy an expensive
dongle for my new expensive laptop in order to use &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; with it. Also,
the functionality of the adaptors seems to be hit or miss. I got one that
works okay, but only after having to return the first one I bought because it
just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t connect my devices. Very Annoying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrists Rest&lt;/strong&gt; - While I really enjoy the solid feel of the aluminum my
hands rest on (and how it tends to stay cool even when the computer is heating
up), the sharp edge of the laptop cuts into my wrist over time. I will admit
that this is something I have experience on other laptops too. Maybe I just
type wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-table.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Macbook Pro on table&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-table.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The 16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro is a great all in one portable
workstation&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I love this laptop. It is powerful enough to do everything I
need, and I think Apple has done a great job addressing the complaints users
have had with Macbooks over the last few years. Considering the speaker,
microphone, keyboard, and screen upgrades this is an amazing portable
workstation. As much as I love having a full desk setup, the &amp;ldquo;built-in
periphery devices&amp;rdquo; on this laptop are &lt;em&gt;so good&lt;/em&gt;, I really don&amp;rsquo;t mind working
straight from the laptop. Which coming from &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, is saying something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Challenge - 30 Days with macOS</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/macos-challenge/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/macos-challenge/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have used many operating systems on my computers over the years, including
decades worth of Windows versions, tons of Linux distros, several BSDs, iOS,
Android, and even chromeOS. While I am familiar with using macOS
(I often used the school Macs in college, and my wife had a Macbook Air
throughout medical school), it is the one OS I have never tried as my &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt;
daily driver. After switching to an iPhone and &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/getting-an-ipad/&#34;&gt;getting an
iPad&lt;/a&gt; this year&amp;hellip; I
decided to give macOS a spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Fun fact: I first learned about Linux while attempting to Hackintosh my
laptop in high school.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a mac as the interface device during my personal computing, for 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, &amp;ldquo;interface computer&amp;rdquo; means the device that I sit at and interact with.
For example, I might be sitting at macOS and using it for my web browsing and
music, but working on a project on my linux workstation via a mosh/tmux session
in iTerm. I can use remote Linux computers as much as I please, but should
connect to them through macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that I still used Desktop Linux as my &amp;ldquo;interfacing
computer&amp;rdquo; for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind iOS and macOS teaming up to make my &amp;ldquo;normal person&amp;rdquo;
computing (web browsing, video chatting, emails, and online courses)
easier. I still deeply care about working with Linux at home, but exclusively
on the backend. So having the front end get out of the way, and not tempt me
with the ability to fine-tune it, is a good thing (&lt;em&gt;for me&lt;/em&gt;, currently).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(While I&amp;rsquo;ve slowed down &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=distrohopper&#34;&gt;distro
hopping&lt;/a&gt; the last
few years,&amp;hellip; I have still been swapping my desktop environment every other
month).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I am really only interested in using macOS for my personal
computing.  At work, I don&amp;rsquo;t need my computer to be in step with my personal
phone and/or ipad. In fact, I like having that barrier there. Also, Linux works
REALLY well for the work I do, especially when it comes to running VMs (I love
&lt;code&gt;libvirt&lt;/code&gt;). So, there currently isn&amp;rsquo;t a reason (or even a desire) to switch
there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side Note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I actually wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even consider this challenge if I didn&amp;rsquo;t
get to use Linux so much at work every day, or if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have my Linux
desktop/workstation at home. I already ssh into my desktop to work
from my other devices. In fact, I technically remote into my desktop even when
I&amp;rsquo;m working &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; it, since I do everything in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://podman.io&#34;&gt;container&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;observations&#34;&gt;Observations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a few weeks in macOS, lets break down some observations I
had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;stuff-i-didn-t-like&#34;&gt;Stuff I didn&amp;rsquo;t like&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The elephant in the room… it&amp;rsquo;s very proprietary. I still love open source and
using something that&amp;rsquo;s as locked down and secretive as macOS (and Apple
products in general) feels, well&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;dirty&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/joplin-error.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;joplin error&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/joplin-error.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Error while trying to run Joplin&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had trouble getting some applications like &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/switched-to-joplin-notes/&#34;&gt;Joplin&lt;/a&gt; to work. I later learned that it was likely due to issues with signing the applications in Catalina (I think). Apparently, there is a work-around for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There surprisingly isn’t a great solution for &lt;a href=&#34;https://virt-manager.org&#34;&gt;virt-manager&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to install it using homebrew, but have to launch it from the terminal. I guess I might be able to setup an application launcher for it? I&amp;rsquo;m just surprised there isn&amp;rsquo;t a better solution on mac, or at least one that&amp;rsquo;s easy to find&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that note, it is &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;a href=&#34;https://brew.sh&#34;&gt;brew&lt;/a&gt; exists, but it confuses the hell out of me (What&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;code&gt;cask&lt;/code&gt;? Is it like a &lt;a href=&#34;https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#group-command-label&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dnf group&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; install?). This is most likely because I am new to it, but in my opinion, I still think it is nowhere near as nice as default Linux package managers. This is one area where using Linux for so long has definitely spoiled me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with filesystems is a pain, especially when connecting to network devices. I couldn’t use Finder to do an easy network connection without first setting up samba or nfs on my Linux computers. While I ideally want to setup a proper samba/nfs server on my desktop/server in the long run anyway, it was annoying that it couldn’t just mount the system in the file browser, using something like &lt;code&gt;sftp&lt;/code&gt; under the hood like Linux does..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;video style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; controls&gt;
&lt;source src=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/network-connect.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Connecting to a remote server&amp;rsquo;s filesystem from the
file browser in Gnome (Linux)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Window management isn’t great out of the box. I had to buy &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12&#34;&gt;magnet&lt;/a&gt; to snap/tile my windows. (Alternatively for touch-bar mac users, note that &lt;a href=&#34;https://folivora.ai&#34;&gt;better touch tool&lt;/a&gt; has window snapping and other features built in). Also, I can’t seem to hold a key and click a window anywhere to resize/move like I can in most linux DEs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My desktop workspaces keep changing their order on me (ಠ_ಠ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deviating from the stock experience can become painful.  Don&amp;rsquo;t like using a global menubar, and a dock for applications?&amp;hellip; sorry?
I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are third-party ways to get around it, but they are likely
hacky and not guaranteed to always work across new versions of macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;stuff-i-liked&#34;&gt;Stuff I liked&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I  am actually starting to like the CMD-centric shortcuts. They work everywhere and are nice when working in a terminal (which I do all the time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default keybindings, while different from what I’m used to are intuitive, and consistent across the system. There are not many that are crazy. For example, on Windows/Linux systems, the keybinding to close a window usually defaults to &lt;code&gt;Alt+F4&lt;/code&gt;, so I normally change it to &lt;code&gt;Super+Shift+Q&lt;/code&gt;. While not the exact same as what I do, the macOS default of &lt;code&gt;CMD+Q&lt;/code&gt; is close enough that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to easily adapt to it, without feeling the need to figure out how to change it. It&amp;rsquo;s a similar story across most of the default keybindings. They aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly how I&amp;rsquo;ve been setting mine up, but close enough that I&amp;rsquo;m fine with accepting them as is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iCloud syncing has been nice. Specifically for photos, TODOs, and notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/phonecall.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Receiving and answering a phonecall in macOS&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/phonecall.png&#34; style=&#34;float: right; max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like being able to answer &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; phone calls from my computer.
I hate talking on the phone. Oddly
enough, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind voice chat on the computer, so this works out really
well for me. Synced iMessage and Facetime are also nice, but universal
&lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; phone calls is what I particularly enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profiles. Specifically, setting up something like my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastmail.com&#34;&gt;Fastmail&lt;/a&gt; account in the mail app
was SUPER easy because of this. I basically just downloaded the profile
from fastmail and opened it with mail, and everytihng was setup. That&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find the UI to be really space respecting. In addition to a global menu, title bars on windows are thin and minimal. Combined with scaled font sizes, a lot less space is wasted, especially compared to Gnome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/header-bar-comparison-stacked.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;macOS header bars compared to Gnome&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/header-bar-comparison-stacked.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;I find macOS to be much more space efficient than Gnome&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos just work without configuring anything/switching back and forth between Wayland and X sessions. I have faith that wayland will mature to this point eventually, but its nice to already have it in macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gestures are fluid and intuitive. Even on the old MacBook air, the trackpad
is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Settings like screentime work across all my “front-end devices”. If I set a downtime for 8:30pm, it boots me off all my devices&amp;hellip; and I get to bed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;macOS comes with a set of well-made core apps (calendar, mail, notes, music,
photos, keynote, garage band, etc). They work for everything I need. If I
want something more advanced, I generally have the full selection of open source and
proprietary apps at my disposal. For example, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Gimp just
fine on the macbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security does actually seem to be a focus on the system. For example, someone
tried to log into my icloud account from a random location the other week.
In under a minute, from my phone, I was able to unlink my account from all
my devices and change the password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;future-plans&#34;&gt;Future Plans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;rsquo;d say this challenge was a success. In fact, it was so successfull,
that I&amp;rsquo;m actually writing up this post on a new &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/&#34;&gt;base model 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook
Pro&lt;/a&gt; (but more on &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; at another time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[ Well, I&amp;rsquo;m really writing it on my desktop, but from the macbook pro ;) ]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan is to use macOS and my iOS
devices to handle my interactive/client computing. I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed having my
apple devices take care of all my &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; person computer needs over the last
few weeks. It has allowed me to finish up required, but mundane tasks easily
and efficiently, so I can better focus when diving into iTerm to work on
complicated Linux server projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I do have some reservations about this plan (mostly that my desktop Linux
skills will fade, and that I&amp;rsquo;ll loose respect in the Linux community), I don&amp;rsquo;t
think it should be too much of an issue. At the end of the day, it is most
important that I am able to spend my limited time learning and building in the
areas I want to focus on, which is back-end, rather than front-end Linux. I
want to love all technology, and be able to help people find the best solution
to their problems, no matter what they use. Maybe one day the OS flame wars
will die down and we can all just get along and build cool shit together.. Till
then, wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I Got an iPad</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/getting-an-ipad/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/getting-an-ipad/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering getting a tablet device for the
first time since I was in college. After researching all sorts of options, I
had myself convinced that I would likely be picking up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/ipad-9.7/&#34;&gt;2018 9.7&amp;rdquo;
iPad&lt;/a&gt; at some point. Then I ordered an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro-10-5&#34;&gt;iPad
Pro 10.5&amp;rdquo; (2017 model)&lt;/a&gt;.
Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-a-tablet&#34;&gt;Why a Tablet?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I use technology, I try to plan out and use devices which best fit the
tasks I want to accomplish. After evaluating my work habits, I started to
think that a tablet might function well in many of my use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/keyone.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Blackberry KEYone&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/keyone.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; width: 250px; float: left;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason? I don&amp;rsquo;t like using smart phones. I think modern phones
are a wonderful piece of technology, but they are often misused. While some
smart phone apps can greatly enhance one&amp;rsquo;s life, many are convenient
distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My phone is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; with me, so I keep the set of apps installed on it to a
minimum. I try to use apps that are most needed &amp;ldquo;on the go&amp;rdquo; (maps/lyft,
music/podcasts, and various communication apps). I find that this helps prevent
me from easily distracting myself throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I realized that the experience of some tasks on the phone isn&amp;rsquo;t
great, and that they would likely be best completed on a tablet. Additionally,
setting up a tablet for these apps meant I could still enjoy them in a more
portable way, but maintain a clean, distraction-free phone. Some of the
activities I intended to offload from my phone are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;portable-media-consumption&#34;&gt;Portable Media Consumption&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/youtube-logo.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Youtube Logo&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/youtube-logo.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: right; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually consume the majority of my media either on our TV, or at my computer.
That being said, I did start to notice myself watching Youtube, Hulu, and
Netflix, more often from my phone. This usually occurred when the TV was in use,
or I simply wanted to watch from a different location (ex: my bed). Having a
small screen and tinny speakers, watching video on a phone is terrible.
This is especially true on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gsmarena.com/blackberry_keyone-8508.php&#34;&gt;Blackberry
KEYone&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;even
smaller&lt;/em&gt; screen (Which I choose because it is a great &lt;em&gt;communication device&lt;/em&gt;, with a long
battery life. Regardless, even on a large, bezel-less phone screen, watching video
on a smart phone is still sub-optimal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In college, I used my previous tablet (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_Pad_Transformer&#34;&gt;an Asus Transformer
T101&lt;/a&gt;, with no dock) to
watch videos in my dorm or around campus. I loved it&amp;rsquo;s convenient, but yet
still enticing viewing experience. I assumed that with a modern tablet,
it would only be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being such a visual learner, I tend to gravitate towards visual media. Reading
however, is much less passive than video. When watching a movie, it will
continue to progress whether the viewer is paying attention or not. Reading is
much more &lt;em&gt;self-driven&lt;/em&gt;, which I find helps to build my concentration. As a
result, reading is something I am always trying to do more of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/leanyouahaskell.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Learn You A Haskell for Great Good Book&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/leanyouahaskell.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; width: 260px; float: left; margin: 25px 25px 25px 25px; &#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have owned a kindle paperwhite for years, and it is perfect for reading
books.  However, there are some types of reading material that my kindle falls
simply does not handle well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.humblebundle.com/books/&#34;&gt;Humble Book
Bundles&lt;/a&gt;, I have acquired a collection of
programming, DevOps, system administration, and general technology ebooks. You
know&amp;hellip; the type of book that is &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; classified as a &amp;ldquo;textbook&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;
but does not sound nearly as cool when I call it that&amp;hellip;  Anyway the point
is&amp;hellip; they are &lt;em&gt;horrendous&lt;/em&gt; to read on the kindle. I would love the ability
to flip through a &lt;em&gt;textbook&lt;/em&gt; on a large, color screen, and a tablet enables that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/pocket-logo.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Pocket Logo&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/pocket-logo.svg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; width: 175px; float: right; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px; &#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the internet is full of all sorts of &amp;ldquo;articles&amp;rdquo;. News stories, blog posts,
product announcements, opinion pieces, tutorials, reviews&amp;hellip; all litter the
internet. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been starting to corral this craziness by using tools
such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpocket.com/&#34;&gt;pocket&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;save&lt;/em&gt; articles I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to read.
Then, I can come back and batch-read them later. This helps me break the
endless rabbit-hole of digging through, and semi-reading &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;related&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; articles
(half of which aren&amp;rsquo;t even good).  This practice has worked &lt;em&gt;alright&lt;/em&gt; on my
computer, but I do think it would be &lt;em&gt;ideal&lt;/em&gt; to sit down in an
armchair with a tablet in my lap, for my batch reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;offload-some-of-my-smart-phone-use&#34;&gt;Offload &lt;em&gt;Some&lt;/em&gt; of My Smart Phone Use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously stated, my biggest motivation for buying a tablet is to offload
my phone usage to it. This is particularly true for apps which I am &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt;
to use&amp;hellip; but don&amp;rsquo;t need to have access to at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best example of this? Banking and other financial apps. I appreciate the
ease of modern banking, and love that I can simply take a picture to deposit a
check. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t need this on my phone. Not only am I unlikely to be
scanning checks and moving money around my bank accounts in public&amp;hellip; it is not
really safe to be doing so. I&amp;rsquo;d rather just wait until I get home on my own
network, and do my banking from a tablet (which stays at home much more
frequently than my phone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-options&#34;&gt;Other Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;android-tablets&#34;&gt;Android Tablets&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started looking at tablets, I quickly noticed that the market had
changed &lt;em&gt;dramatically&lt;/em&gt; from a just few years ago. While there are still android
tablets &lt;em&gt;available&lt;/em&gt;, the future of Google &lt;em&gt;supporting&lt;/em&gt; android on tablets is a
bit unclear. They appear to be trying to shift everything to ChromeOS, as
demonstrated with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_slate?hl=en-US&#34;&gt;Pixel
Slate&lt;/a&gt;.
Additionally, Android still tends to treat tablets as just a large screened phone, and
applications are often not optimized for it. Understandably, I was a little leery about
Android tablets. As for ChromOS tablets, the Slate is currently the only real
contender, but with it&amp;rsquo;s high price point, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jsqZMCPJts&#34;&gt;lack-luster
reviews&lt;/a&gt;, it was out of the
running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;amazon-fire-tablets&#34;&gt;Amazon Fire Tablets&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/firetablet.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Amazon Fire Tablet&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/firetablet.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; width: 300px; float: right; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px; &#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the pixel slate, at the low end of the tablet market was the
Amazon fire tablet family.  These devices are quite affordable and would work
well for anyone that just wants to read/watch video on a tablet (especially
Amazon content). However, I just felt that the Fire tablet might be a bit too
limiting for me, as I tend to push technology as far as I can.  Beyond that,
the cheaper iterations of each tablet are the &amp;ldquo;special offers&amp;rdquo; ones, which show
amazon ads on the tablet. By the time I had selected a 10&amp;rdquo; tablet &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt;
special offers, the price point started approaching (well&amp;hellip; almost) another
contender&amp;hellip; the 2018 iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-an-ipad&#34;&gt;Why an iPad?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/ipod-video.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Pocket Logo&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/ipod-video.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin: 20px 20px 10px 10px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;my-apple-device-history&#34;&gt;My Apple Device History&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally wanted to do a full &lt;em&gt;multi-paragraph section&lt;/em&gt; detailing my limited
use of apple products throughout my life, and how I only really buy them when
they &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; stand out above the competition. But that would be
pretentious, extremely boring, and quite honestly, annoying. So in short: the
only Apple devices that I have owned are 1) an iPod Video, and 2) iPod Touch.
So why am I willing to get an iPad as my tablet device?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ipad&#34;&gt;iPad&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While researching, I found that the Apple &lt;em&gt;iPad&lt;/em&gt; was consistently
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD1zTrs2EMw&#34;&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7eNq6hTm5E&#34;&gt;as
a&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGkr6Cjr0TI&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;great-value&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3PFt1Y8ZgA&#34;&gt;tablet-device&lt;/a&gt; on the market
today. Most notably, the 2018 entry-level iPad, which
sold for $330 USD, but could often be found on sale for under $300.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aimed at the education market, the 2018 iPad saw a cpu upgrade, and support for
the Apple pencil. The only con I ran into people reporting was that because it
didn&amp;rsquo;t have a laminated screen, there was a bit of a &amp;ldquo;gap&amp;rdquo; between it and the
glass. Despite the minor screen issue, this was still the best device I could find
around that price range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-the-10-5-pro&#34;&gt;Why the 10.5&amp;rdquo; Pro?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/ipadpro.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;iPad 10.5&#34; Pro&#39; src=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/ipadpro.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; width: 350px; float: right; margin: 20px 20px 10px 10px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; why did I end up with the 10.5&amp;rdquo; iPad Pro? The switch happened last minute
the morning I ended up ordering it. My upgrade happened because of
two factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sale&lt;/strong&gt;: The iPad Pro 10.5&amp;rdquo; had gone on a sale at BestBuy, and the
configuration I liked dropped to $499 (from $650). While this was a bit
more expensive, I thought it was still a good deal, and the 2018 iPad
wasn&amp;rsquo;t on sale anywhere so it was the full $330.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features&lt;/strong&gt;: Essentially, the Pro had a slightly larger and &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better display, better speakers, and double the storage space (64GB compared to 32GB). These are features that I don&amp;rsquo;t think most people need to care about, I knew I would really appreciate those features, especially now that I could get them for only a ~$170 increase over the iPad, compared to the normal $310 difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;rsquo;s the history and reasoning as to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I decided to
get a tablet device, and why that device ultimately ended up being an iPad
10.5&amp;rdquo; Pro. It arrived a couple weeks ago, and I have been enjoying it so far. I
think I&amp;rsquo;ll give myself a bit more time with it, before I even &lt;em&gt;attempt&lt;/em&gt; to write any
sort of review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
