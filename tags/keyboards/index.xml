      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past month, I have been learning to type&amp;hellip; on my new keyboard!  I
decided to purchase an &lt;a href=&#34;https://ergodox-ez.com&#34;&gt;ergodox-ex&lt;/a&gt; and have been using
it ever since. I still &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-hhkb-pro2/&#34;&gt;my HHKB&lt;/a&gt;, so why did I get
a new keyboard? And why&amp;hellip; the ergodox?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;previous-keyboard&#34;&gt;Previous Keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/got-hhkb.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Getting the HHKB
Keyboard&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/got-hhkb.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:
100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;My Happy Hacking Pro Keyboard&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a few years, I have been gladly using a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hhkeyboard.com/uk/products/pro2/&#34;&gt;Happy Hacking Pro
2&lt;/a&gt; keyboard.  Before that, I was
on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://deskthority.net/wiki/HHKB_Lite&#34;&gt;Happy Hacking Lite&lt;/a&gt;, which I
started using while in college. I love the layout of HHK and still think it&amp;rsquo;s
an amazing keyboard. The years I spent on HKBs are why I think &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; keyboard
should have &lt;code&gt;ctrl&lt;/code&gt; instead of a &lt;code&gt;caps&lt;/code&gt; key, or at least switch to two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rationale-for-a-new-one&#34;&gt;Rationale for a new one&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I love my HHKB and have no &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; complaints, there were a few things that
pushed me to start looking at new boards again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-was-getting-the-itch-to-build-one&#34;&gt;I was getting the itch to &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; one&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial motivation was the slow, growing itch to build a mechanical
keyboard.  It is an itch that I&amp;rsquo;ve felt before. I purchased my HHKB Pro as a
&lt;em&gt;backup&lt;/em&gt; plan when the order for a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://olkb.com/collections/planck&#34;&gt;planck&lt;/a&gt; keyboard kit via  mass.com was
unfortunately cancelled. My &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; intention was to learn how to solder (I
even brought a soldering iron), and build the keyboard from scratch. Ultimately buying the
HHKB, I never got to scratch that itch. While I &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; still haven&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip;
this is what had me looking at keyboards and browsing
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/&#34;&gt;/r/MechanicalKeyboards&lt;/a&gt; again in the
first place&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wanted-a-program-able-board&#34;&gt;Wanted a program-able board&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;405&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5aJ9U5t9oD4?start=557&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The keyboard firmware can be customized on some System76 laptops, as demonstrated during this review.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More important than &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; building a keyboard, I wanted to be able to
&lt;em&gt;programatically&lt;/em&gt; build it. That is to say, play with custom firmware. This is
something that my HHKB doesn&amp;rsquo;t have, but the plank did. The
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&amp;amp;c=165&#34;&gt;pok3r&lt;/a&gt;,
which I&amp;rsquo;ve considered in the past, also has programmable layers. Even some of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://system76.com/laptops&#34;&gt;System76&amp;rsquo;s laptops&lt;/a&gt; now allow the ability to
remap their keyboards using open firmware (which is awesome!). The
&lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; thing I wanted from a new keyboard was the ability to customize and
program the layers and layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;after-starting-to-learn-proper-touch-typing-i-wanted-to-try-an-ortholinear-layout&#34;&gt;After starting to learn proper touch typing, I wanted to try an ortholinear layout&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in mostly the same space for much of this year, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that my
wrists and arms have really started to tighten up. So, I put my foot down
and decided it was time once again to try and force myself to &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt;
touch type&amp;hellip; using all of my fingers. Normally, I slide my hands across the board
and have just a few fingers do the bulk of the work.  This not only creates
unnecessary movement, but also over-strains parts of my hands, building up tension
in my wrists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/touch_type_diagram.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;The Minecraft Flathub Page&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/touch_type_diagram.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Proper&amp;rsquo; finger key map for touch typing on a standard
layout&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I started typing with proper finger use, I noticed my hands &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; have a
hard time hitting some keys. Particularly the bottom row, especially with my
left hand, gave me trouble. My other fingers commonly blocked the path that the
&amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; finger needed to reach a key. It became obvious why I naturally
adapted to sliding across the board over the years. I wondered if an
ortholinear layout would better allow me to touch type properly, using all of
my fingers. My hope was that the straight grid would let my fingers
slide directly up and down to the other rows, without crossing over and
impeding my other fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-shoulder-pain-increased&#34;&gt;My shoulder pain increased&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last straw, promoting my keyboard urgency to something I &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; to order
&lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, was that my shoulder was beginning to hurt&amp;hellip; all the time. During my
search, I noticed split keyboards and thought they might
help to alleviate some of my pain. The ability to type with my arms
positioned at any width would at least allow me to vary my shoulder angle as
it got sore. So, I switched from looking at DIY kits, to pre-built split
keyboards that I could have shipped and under my fingers much quicker than I
could order and build one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;keyboard-considerations&#34;&gt;Keyboard Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With requirements decided, I started searching for my keyboard. Both of the
keyboards that I considered are made and sold from the same company,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://zsa.io&#34;&gt;ZSA&lt;/a&gt;. From what I read online, they were usually highly
recommended, with people rating both ZSA&amp;rsquo;s products and customer service very
well. Personally, I enjoyed reading about their focus on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/sustainability&#34;&gt;sustainability&lt;/a&gt; and creating open
source products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;moonlander&#34;&gt;Moonlander&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/moonlander.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;The Minecraft Flathub Page&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/moonlander.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Moonlander&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first keyboard that caught my eye was the new
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/&#34;&gt;Moonlander&lt;/a&gt;. When I first saw it, it had
&lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; been released. I admired it&amp;rsquo;s floating keys and slim profile.
Apparently, it was designed to be at least somewhat portable, as it comes with
a carrying case. The board seemed to be a fresh new take on the ergodox, with a
clever folding design and some newer features like usb-c.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;405&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mWu-_ACpSgY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to dig deep to learn anything about the moonlander as there were only a
handful of people that had them at the time. As I dug, I passively learned
more and more about the ergodox&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ergodox-ez&#34;&gt;Ergodox-EZ&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/ergodox_configurator.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;The Minecraft Flathub Page&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/ergodox_configurator.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Ergodox-EZ Configurator&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the moonlander, ZSA also builds and sells the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ergodox-ez.com&#34;&gt;ergodox-ez&lt;/a&gt; (and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck&#34;&gt;planck
ez&lt;/a&gt;, but I wanted a split board). The
ergodox-ez is a pre-built version of the well-known (to keyboard nerds&amp;hellip;),
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Ergodox-io&#34;&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt;, ortholinear, split keyboard, the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://deskthority.net/wiki/ErgoDox&#34;&gt;ergodox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the Moonlander&amp;rsquo;s features and design, but I ultimately
decided to go with the ergodox-ez for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Moonlander is brand-new and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much feedback for it
yet, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LALQsqZP1nA&#34;&gt;whereas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GPHiJMS7eo&#34;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/comfortable-ergo-keyboard/&#34;&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/03/03/why-this-300-ergonomic-keyboard-might-actually-be-worth-the-money/&#34;&gt;plenty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rtings.com/keyboard/reviews/ergodox/ez&#34;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mmorpg.com/hardware-reviews/ergodox-ez-this-is-what-powerful-looks-like-2000107228&#34;&gt;information&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://matteeyah.com/ergodox-ez-keyboard&#34;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; the ergodox-ez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, because the ergodox has been a popular design for years
now, 3rd-party parts like specialized keycaps sets
can easily be found on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mass.com/&#34;&gt;mass.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mechsupply.co.uk&#34;&gt;other
websites&lt;/a&gt;. This makes the ergodox a bit easier
to customize than the moonlander, at least currently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ergodox is great starting board for testing out the
orthlinear+split design. If there were parts of it I really hated over the
next few years, I could always switch to a moonlander or another split board that better fits my needs,
based on what I learn from the ergodox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if I instead &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the ergodox design and want &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; in a few
years for some reason, I still have the option to &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; one.. and &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt;
scratch that itch XD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a win-win situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered the Ergodox-ez and have had it for a over a month now. If you are
wondering what configuration I selected, and what I think about it so far&amp;hellip;
stay tuned for my next post ;) .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro 2</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/new-hhkb-pro2/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/new-hhkb-pro2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After years of using a Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite, I have &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; decided to splurge on a Happy Hacking Professional 2 keyboard. And I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I have been slowly chipping away at this post for the last few months. I have been very busy, but I should be able to get back into the swing of writing again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-history-with-the-hhkb-lite&#34;&gt;My history with the HHKB Lite&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/college-computer.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Getting the HHKB Keyboard&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/college-computer.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;My Computer (HHKB lite included) during my senior year of college&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started using Linux during my senior year of high school. In college, I started diving deeper down the rabbit hole, learning more about shells, window managers, and programming. By senior year, I found myself sitting in front of an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.archlinux.org&#34;&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt; install, configured with a tiling window manger to organize the scattering of VIM and VIM-like terminal applications I used every day. To be kind to my wrists, I wanted something that was optimized at the hardware level for my heavy &lt;em&gt;CTRL&lt;/em&gt; key use. This is when I first learned about the HHKB. However, as a broke college student, I opted for the much cheaper &lt;em&gt;lite&lt;/em&gt; version to test out. I enjoyed the layout so much, that years later when I needed to replace a keyboard at work, I had them order me a HHKB lite (again, the Pro was very expensive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;time-for-a-mechanical-keyboard&#34;&gt;Time for a Mechanical Keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of using the standard rubber dome HHKB lite, I wanted to finally switch to a true mechanical keyboard. I searched long and hard, looking at different layouts designs, and learning about the various switch types (mostly the commony &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_(keyboards)&#34;&gt;cherry MX switches&lt;/a&gt;). After purchasing and playing with a switch tester, I confirmed that I would likely enjoy MX clear switches best. They are quiet enough I could still reasonably use them in an office, but still had the nice tactile bump that I love (more than what I experienced on the Browns). Additionally, I knew that I wanted to stick with a small, minimalist layout, so I exclusively looked at &lt;a href=&#34;https://deskthority.net/wiki/60%25&#34;&gt;60% keyboards&lt;/a&gt;, with the occasional &lt;a href=&#34;https://deskthority.net/wiki/40%25&#34;&gt;40%&lt;/a&gt; board catching my eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8wjW-Or1jg8/maxresdefault.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The Pok3r Keyboard&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/pok3r.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Pok3r Keyboard&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many, I eventually landed at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://deskthority.net/wiki/Vortex_Pok3r&#34;&gt;Vortex Pok3r&lt;/a&gt;. It is beautiful, with a minimal, but sturdy appearance, and has a MX clear variant. I had made my decision, but at the time, new boards weren&amp;rsquo;t available. I decided to sit back and wait to see if it would drop on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.massdrop.com/&#34;&gt;Massdrop&lt;/a&gt; any time soon. I had waited years to purchase a mechanical keyboard, and I could wait a little longer to get the one I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-planck-drop&#34;&gt;The Planck Drop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The Planck Keyboard&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/planck.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Planck Keyboard&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was waiting for a Pok3r drop&amp;hellip; something interesting caught my eye on Massdrop&amp;hellip; the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.massdrop.com/buy/planck-mechanical-keyboard&#34;&gt;Planck keyboard&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; The planck is a keyboard kit that you solder together to create a programmable, &lt;em&gt;ortholinear&lt;/em&gt;, 40% keyboard. When I say &lt;em&gt;programmable&lt;/em&gt;, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean that you can just bind some keys. The Planck is fully open and the firmware C code is available on Github for modification. So, you can actually customize and hack together the firmware, which was very appealing to me. So I joined the drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After joining, I purchased a soldering kit so that I could construct the keyboard once it finally shipped. Unfortunately, the planck drop had &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; delays, but as I previously stated, I didn&amp;rsquo;t waiting. The planck got delayed &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much, that they eventually allowed people to cancel their order and receive a refund. I thought the order cancellation was something you &lt;em&gt;opted in&lt;/em&gt; to do, but it was actually an &lt;em&gt;opt out&lt;/em&gt; situation&amp;hellip; so my lack of response had my order canceled, pre-maturely ending my planck experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;deciding-on-the-hhkb-pro&#34;&gt;Deciding on the HHKB Pro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my planck order canceled, and a refund imminent, I started to look at other options again. The main contender was still the Pok3r. I started researching it again and learning about how I could program the layers to have a layout I would like&amp;hellip; and eventually realized I just kept re-creating the infamous HHKB layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started to consider the HHKB again. My main reasons for not getting it originally was that it is a good bit more expensive than the majority of mechanical keyboards on the market. However, after waiting months for the planck, and noticing I kept comparing everything to the HHKB, I realized I would eventually end up with an HHKB anyway, and decided to just go for it now. Decision made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-the-hhkb&#34;&gt;Getting the HHKB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/got-hhkb.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Getting the HHKB Keyboard&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/got-hhkb.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;My HHKB&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I decided on the HHKB, (and it was approved by my wife :P ), I purchased it on Amazon. The one thing I did contemplate about was which color to get. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if I wanted to get the black or white model. I knew I wanted printed key-caps, and that made the white board very appealing. The printed keys on it look &lt;em&gt;so crisp&lt;/em&gt;. Eventually, I decided on the dark gray because it matches everything else I own, whereas the white board would drastically stick out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I placed the order and within a few days, it was on my doorstep (well, the neighbor&amp;rsquo;s, but that&amp;rsquo;s an issue with our post&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-like&#34;&gt;What I like&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;layout&#34;&gt;Layout&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As already mentioned, I love they HHKB layout. It was a bit tricky to get accustomed to at first, but that was &lt;em&gt;several years&lt;/em&gt; ago at this point. The HKKB Pro does have a few difference in layout when compared to the lite version (the pro does not have a bottom left &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; key, or any dedicated arrow keys). However, I had prepared myself for this change over the last few years by only using the right &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; key and the &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; arrow keys. The hardest thing to adjust to was the slightly different sized &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt; keys on the left (due to the missing &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; key).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have learned to appreciate all the little HHKB layout differences. This includes the &amp;ldquo;delete&amp;rdquo; by default backspace key, with the &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; key above it, and the &lt;code&gt;ESC&lt;/code&gt; key next to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. Last but not least, &lt;strong&gt;the CTRL in the CAPS location&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(with CAPs still available as &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;Tab&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. I honestly think this should be the standard keyboard layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;pbt-key-caps&#34;&gt;PBT key-caps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect the PBT key-caps to be such a big deal, but I absolutely love them. I could tell from images that they would &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; better (especially the white ones), but I didn&amp;rsquo;t anticipate how great they would feel. They are solid, but with a soft touch, and are a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better improvement over every keyboard I have previously owned/used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-switches&#34;&gt;The Switches&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how I would like the topre switches after getting excited for Cherry MX clears. However, I seem to really like them&amp;hellip; at least on the HHKB. I have heard that they feel different on the HHKB compared to other Topre keyboards due to the HHKBs plastic back. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this is true or not, but I like the result. Key presses are smooth but at the same time very crisp. Being a heavy typist, I often bottom out, but when I do it feels very soft, and not harsh at all. I figure that if I am going to bottom out on my keys regardless of what keyboard I have, it is probably best to handle it how the HHKB does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;can-i-say-sound&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip; Can I say sound?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the sound of typing on this keyboard. While it is definitely an audible keyboard, it isn&amp;rsquo;t nearly as obnoxious as louder clicky switches, like MX Blues or Greens. It has a soft, muted, lower pitched sound as I type (compared to normal &amp;ldquo;clicky&amp;rdquo; switches). I really do enjoy hearing it, and find myself sometimes taking off my headphones to listen to it if I need motivation to get more characters on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-don-t-like&#34;&gt;What I don&amp;rsquo;t like&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;cost&#34;&gt;Cost&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned earlier in the post, probably the &lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; downside to the HHKB is the substantial cost. At &amp;gt;$230 USD, it is expensive, even for mechanical keyboards. The cost is the single problem that kept me from buying it all these years. Eventually, I realized it is what I wanted, and it would likely last me &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;, so it all works out. Additionally, if I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the PRO, or didn&amp;rsquo;t want it anymore, they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have an incredible resale value, so I could likely get a large chunk of my money back fairly easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;transporting-it-related-to-cost&#34;&gt;Transporting it (related to cost)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the cost issue is mitigated after just biting the bullet and hitting the &amp;ldquo;check out&amp;rdquo; button, there is another minor annoyance that is &lt;em&gt;related&lt;/em&gt; to the high price. Ideally, I&amp;rsquo;d like to use my HKKB whenever I am at the computer. Being a software developer&amp;hellip; I use a computer for 8+ hours a day at work. So, I like to use my keyboard at work&amp;hellip; but I also like to bring it home. Ideally, I&amp;rsquo;d get two: one for home and one for at the office. At the high price point though&amp;hellip; I might have to wait to make that purchase. As far as keyboards go, I&amp;rsquo;d say the HHKB is probably one of the best travel boards out there. It&amp;rsquo;s light, but sturdy, and there is even a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Carrying-Happy-Hacking-Keyboard-PD-KB01SD/dp/B000FHSNFW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1514499138&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=HHKB+case go&#34;&gt;travel case designed specifically for it&lt;/a&gt;. So far I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the box to transport it, but am going to get the traveling case soon. That should hold me over until it is justifiable to get a second board. One day&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I actually was just gifted the carrying case for Christmas. I will check out how it works in the new year. It should at the very least be better than the cardboard box it came in&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;mac-mode-delete-fix&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mac&amp;rdquo; mode / Delete &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One benefit of getting the HHKB &lt;em&gt;Pro&lt;/em&gt; over the &lt;em&gt;lite&lt;/em&gt; version, is that it has some media key functionality (volume, start/stop). However, these keys only work when the dip switches are configured to put the board in &amp;ldquo;Mac mode&amp;rdquo;. In addition to enabling the media keys, it changes a few other things, like changing the iconic HHKB &amp;ldquo;Delete&amp;rdquo; key to a more traditional &amp;ldquo;Backspace&amp;rdquo; default. Now, I understand that 99% of people probably welcome this change with open arms. However&amp;hellip; after using the HHKB lite for so many years, I have &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; become accustomed to the &amp;ldquo;delete&amp;rdquo; key there, and actually prefer it now. With how I jump around my editor/terminals with emacs bindings, I have actually developed a workflow where I use &lt;em&gt;delete&lt;/em&gt; more often than &lt;em&gt;backspace&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot figure out a way to have &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;mac mode&lt;/em&gt; and &amp;ldquo;delete key default&amp;rdquo; functionality enabled at the same time. So&amp;hellip; I have opted to just forgo the new media keys, which is unfortunate. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice upgrade from the &lt;em&gt;lite&lt;/em&gt; version, and a shame I can&amp;rsquo;t take advantage of it just because I &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; the default layout of the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;missing-more-modern-features-perks&#34;&gt;Missing more &amp;ldquo;Modern&amp;rdquo; Features/Perks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HHKB being a &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;classic&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, seems to be lacking in some of the more &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; features of high-end keyboards. There is no backlighting, no custom programming/macro setups, or wireless connectivity. I even believe that the two USB ports on the back are USB 2, not 3 (let alone C). While it would be &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; to have some of these features in the HHKB, I&amp;rsquo;m not hurting &lt;em&gt;too badly&lt;/em&gt; for them&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;. A modern refresh would be amazing though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it is a great keyboard and I plan to use it for a long time. Typing on it feels and sounds so natural, and it has the same layout I have grown to love over the last few years. I am thrilled to finally upgrade to the pro, and wish I did so years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
