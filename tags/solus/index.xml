      <title>Quick Start to Docker</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months (particularly over the holiday season), I started to
explore and learn several technologies I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eye on the last few years.
First on the list: &lt;a href=&#34;https://docker.io&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;. These days, Docker has a massive
ecosystem surrounding it, and can take years to truly master. This post on the
other hand, will &lt;em&gt;hopefully&lt;/em&gt; help you get up and playing with docker containers in
just a few minutes. Lets get started.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Back to Solus</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, that was faster than I expected. This past weekend, I wiped the Fedora installation on my main computer, and replaced it with Solus. My Fedora install broke, and I needed to use a Fedora Live CD to fix it. I thought that if I had to use a live CD to fix the issue, I might as well just do a clean install. With the idea of a clean install in my head&amp;hellip; I thought (possibly influenced by my recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://ryan.himmelwright.net/posts/dabbling-with-go/#motivation&#34;&gt;motivation&lt;/a&gt; to play with Go), that I might as well do the clean install with &lt;a href=&#34;solus-project.com/&#34;&gt;Solus&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Migrating from Solus to Fedora for now</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/solus-to-fedora/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For awhile, I have been debating the idea of switching back to Fedora (from Solus). At least on my &lt;a href=&#34;../../pages/homelab/#alakazam&#34;&gt;main computer&lt;/a&gt;. First, let me state this right up front: I am still &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; satisfied with Solus. I think it is one of the best current Linux distros, and I want to still contribute to the project. However, there are a few reasons why Solus isn&amp;rsquo;t the best fit for my needs &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, and I will highlight them below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Refreshing my i3 setup with i3blocks</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/started-using-i3blocks/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last couple of weeks I have shifted back to using the i3 window mangers. When I fired it up, my fingers danced across the keyboard, remembering all of the personalized keybindings I have cultivated in my i3 configuration over the years. It is a simple, beautiful setup&amp;hellip; well, beautiful minus one of the components. My i3status bar was looking rather bland and dated, especially compared some of the i3 setups posted by all the cool kids over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/&#34;&gt;/r/unixporn&lt;/a&gt;. I decided it was time for a refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
