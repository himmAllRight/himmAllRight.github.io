      <title>Using Remote VSCode</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I mostly work on &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/selecting-charmeleons-upgrades/&#34;&gt;my desktop&lt;/a&gt;, but
usually &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; another computer, like my
&lt;a href=&#34;../../post/m1-air-initial-thoughts/&#34;&gt;laptop&lt;/a&gt;. Historically, the most common
method I use for this has been combining &lt;code&gt;neovim&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt; (with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp&#34;&gt;tmuxp&lt;/a&gt;, for ease). However, more often
than not, I now find myself using &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com&#34;&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt;
with it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview&#34;&gt;remote development
plugin&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s
how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-the-remote-development-plugin&#34;&gt;Install the Remote Development Plugin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, first make sure that VS code is installed on your machine.
This can be found on the project&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;,
or even as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.visualstudio.code&#34;&gt;flathub
flatpak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;video style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; controls&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;../../img/posts/remote-vscode/install_remote_vscode.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;movie.ogg&#34; type=&#34;video/ogg&#34;&gt;
Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Installing the Remote Development Plugin&lt;/id&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, to instal the plugin, click the Extensions tab in the side bar (The
icon with four squares). From there, search for the extension by using
something like &amp;lsquo;remote development&amp;rsquo; as the search term. The &lt;code&gt;Remote
Development&lt;/code&gt; extension should appear in the list. Select it, and click &lt;code&gt;Install&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension is actually a package that bundles three extensions: &lt;code&gt;Remote -
SSH&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Remote - WSL&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Remote - Containers&lt;/code&gt;. Alternatively, you can just install the one you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;connect-to-the-server&#34;&gt;Connect to the Server&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;video style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; controls&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;../../img/posts/remote-vscode/remote_vscode_config.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;movie.ogg&#34; type=&#34;video/ogg&#34;&gt;
Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Connecting to a remote machine in vs code&lt;/id&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the remote plugin installed, we can now connect to a remote machine. I
mostly do this using &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;. Make sure you first have ssh keys copied to the
device you want to link to. Then, open the command pallet (&lt;code&gt;CMD/CTRL-Shift-P&lt;/code&gt;), and search for the &lt;code&gt;Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...&lt;/code&gt; command, and run it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will prompt you for an ssh host to connect to. Just enter a &lt;code&gt;host&lt;/code&gt; like
you would when using &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;. For example, &lt;code&gt;ryan@example.com&lt;/code&gt;. If it&amp;rsquo;s the
first time adding a host, the plugin will ask where it can save a config file
for the hosts. I usually just select one of the defaults it offers me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/remote-vscode/remote_window_status.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Remote Window connected status&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/remote-vscode/remote_window_status.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The connected status is displayed in the lower left of the window (top window: remote, bottom: local)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When connecting to a remote machine, VS code will usually pop open a new
window. To verify, the ip address of the machine that the window is connected
to can be found in lower left corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;working-on-projects-remotely&#34;&gt;Working on Projects, Remotely&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/remote-vscode/open_remote_dir.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Opening a remote dir&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/remote-vscode/open_remote_dir.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Opening a directory in the remote window&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working in a remote VS Code window, everything is passed on from the
remote machine, as if you were sitting down at that computer. When opening a
new file or folder, you browse the contents of the &lt;em&gt;remote filesystem&lt;/em&gt;, not
the local one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the built in terminal runs on the remote machine. I still work in
&lt;code&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt;, so I have my vscode terminal attach whatever &lt;code&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt; session I need.
This provides me with the flexibility to switch to a new machine and pickup
where I left off. Using this setup, I get a full graphical IDE window, while
still reaping the benefits of &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/remote-vscode/working_remote_window.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Working on a post in vs code with vim and tmux opened in the shell&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/remote-vscode/working_remote_window.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Working on this post, with &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; opened in &lt;code&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt; in the built-in terminal&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes&amp;hellip; you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; run &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the built-in VScode
terminal, &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; a VScode remote window. This is something I actually do quite
often XD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am almost always working &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; a different machine than the one which my
files and work are on. This setup has been idea for how I work. It is easy to
use, yet very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting in front a gruvbox-themed VSCode window, connected to my desktop, and
typing using vim keybindings (via a vim plugin) has become my new default, no
matter what computer (or VM) I am physically working from. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2020 M1 Macbook Air Initial Thoughts</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/m1-air-initial-thoughts/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/m1-air-initial-thoughts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As discussed in my &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I decided
to trade-in my 2019 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro and replace it with a new 2020 M1 MacBook
Air. So far, I think making the swap was a terrific idea. Here are
my initial thoughts&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-what-i-ordered&#34;&gt;Background (what I ordered)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/m1_air_box.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The M1 Air Box&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/m1_air_box.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The MacBook Air Box&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, I got the &amp;lsquo;second tier&amp;rsquo; 2020 M1 MacBook Air (Silver, 8 gpu
cores, 512GB ssd) and upgraded the RAM to 16Gb. I wanted to maintain the same
RAM and storage that my MBP had. After an eternity (3+ weeks), the air
was delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-like&#34;&gt;What I Like&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/side.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The M1 Air Side&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/side.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Side of the MacBook Air&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, lets start with the good. There is a lot to say here, but these are my
main thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s cool and &lt;del&gt;quiet&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;silent&lt;/em&gt;. It hardly heats up, and when
it does, it is &lt;em&gt;barely&lt;/em&gt; noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is very portable. I can easily pick it up with one hand, and set it on my
lap nearly anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like having physical function keys again. I even learned
how to utilize &lt;a href=&#34;https://folivora.ai&#34;&gt;BetterTouchTool&lt;/a&gt; for window management
using keyboard shortcuts, instead of the touch bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;video style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; controls&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/wake_compare.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;movie.ogg&#34; type=&#34;video/ogg&#34;&gt;
Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The instant wake is nicer than I thought it would be&lt;/id&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instant wake is actually delightful. I initially thought my sleep settings
were misconfigured, and that the laptop wasn&amp;rsquo;t turning off when I shut
the lid. It&amp;rsquo;s a feature that I thought &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;who cares&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; when it was announced, but
after I tried it, my 16&amp;rdquo; suddenly felt unbearably slow for the few days I had
both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosetta II is amazing at what it does. Most apps just work because of it,
even if they haven&amp;rsquo;t been ported to Apple Silicon yet. This has made the transition
rather seamless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works surprisingly well at my desk on the laptop stand, possibly even
better than the 16&amp;rdquo;. The laptop is about the same size as the stand, so I&amp;rsquo;m
able to push it further back, out of the way, and it is much sturdier. The
smaller screen hasn&amp;rsquo;t been an issue with the content I usually play on it at
my desk (background videos or music). With how cool it runs, I also feel
safer closing it to focus solely on my external monitor, as if I was using a
mac mini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;video style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; controls&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/terminal_compare.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;movie.ogg&#34; type=&#34;video/ogg&#34;&gt;
Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;New tabs in my terminal lagged for some reason on the MBP. Not on the Air.&lt;id&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My terminal instantly opens! For some reason on my mac, it always took
a second to load the shell prompt in iterm with my config. On the air,
it is instant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garage band works much better. It opens immediately and is ready. My 16&amp;rdquo;
would freeze while loading, then sometimes beach-ball and crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battery life is great. I don&amp;rsquo;t really think about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-could-be-better&#34;&gt;What Could be Better&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/macbooks_compare.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;My old MacBook Pro and the new M1 Air&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/macbooks_compare.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Air has thicker bezels compared to my old 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screen bezels are rather thick, even compared to the 16&amp;rdquo; and could use
some slimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More TB ports. The air has two Thunderbolt ports, on only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; side of the
laptop. I use hubs, so I don&amp;rsquo;t usually require more than the two ports, but
it can be an issue to only have them on one side depending on where I want to
place my laptop. Having one port on either side wouldn&amp;rsquo;t solve the issue
either, because I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like wrapping the power cord all the way around to
the other port when my hub is plugged in. The only &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; solution is to have
more than 2 TB ports, split across both sides of the laptop, &lt;em&gt;even if&lt;/em&gt; you
don&amp;rsquo;t need them all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some applications are still tricky to install. For example, I had to
compile &lt;code&gt;neofetch&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;homebrew&lt;/code&gt; (which was simple enough to do). I imagine
this issue should resolve with time. Overall though, I haven&amp;rsquo;t really had any
major installation issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-s-different&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; Different?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/keyboard.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The M1 Air Keyboard&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/keyboard.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The MacBook Air does not have a touchbar&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few things that were neither good nor bad, just &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; coming
from an Intel 16&amp;rdquo; MBP:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, not having the touch bar. Not that I &lt;em&gt;miss&lt;/em&gt; it, but I
apparently got used to checking the time there and had to slowly break that
habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Efficiency cores are weird at first. I would look at my CPU usage when
only running background tasks and wonder why the first four cores had such
high usage, especially when compared to the other four. Eventually, I
realized it was because the tasks were running using mostly the efficiency
cores. So while it &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; like there was a heavy load that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t being
properly balanced across the cores&amp;hellip; the work was actually shifted to be
more efficient. This is the desired functionality, but weird to get used to
at first if you&amp;rsquo;re someone that is constantly watching CPU usage like I do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smaller screen space. I got used to the smaller screen quicker than I
anticipated, and I think the trade-off is worth it for the portability of
this laptop. But it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speakers. The air has &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; speakers&amp;hellip; but the 16&amp;rdquo;
had &lt;em&gt;truely amazing&lt;/em&gt; speakers. Like the screen resolution, this is mostly a physical
size limitation, and I think the trade-off is well worth it here as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/laptop_coffee.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The M1 Air with Coffee&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/m1-air-initial-thoughts/laptop_coffee.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The MacBook Air with my coffee&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This laptop has been remarkable. It reminds me of some of my previous
&lt;em&gt;portable&lt;/em&gt; laptops, like the x230 thinkpad and my x201e. That is a good thing.
I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; both of those computers and their ability to be thrown in a bag on
the go. It is a setup that pairs nicely with a powerful workstation, which &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/selecting-charmeleons-upgrades/&#34;&gt;I
currently have&lt;/a&gt;. While the air has
about the same footprint as both of those previous laptops, it is thinner,
lighter, has more screen space, and is
&lt;em&gt;magnitudes&lt;/em&gt; more powerful. I can&amp;rsquo;t complain with that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Traded my 2019 16&#34; MacBook Pro for a M1 MacBook Air</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over a year has passed since I purchased a &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/&#34;&gt;base model 2019 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook
Pro&lt;/a&gt;. My first Mac. With it&amp;rsquo;s large &amp;ldquo;retina&amp;rdquo;
display, resurrected magic keyboard, and truly &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; speakers, it might
be the most pleasurable laptop I have ever owned. However, I decided to trade
it in&amp;hellip; for a new MacBook &lt;em&gt;air&lt;/em&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mac_challenge.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Installing macOS Cataline on old air&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mac_challenge.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Installing macOS Catalina on my wife&amp;rsquo;s old MacBook Air for my Mac challenge&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Fall of 2019, I decided to do a &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/macos-challenge/&#34;&gt;30 day macOS&lt;/a&gt;
challenge. During the challenge, I learned that while I think Linux is still
my go-to and &lt;em&gt;indispensable&lt;/em&gt; OS, I did enjoy having a mac available for doing
more &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKiAnxjM8Nc&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;normal life computing&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.
Web browsing, writing emails, managing calendars, personal finance, planning
home projects with my wife, ssh&amp;rsquo;ing into servers to code&amp;hellip; that type of
stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the challenge, I decided to acquire a mac for myself. I choose the 16&amp;rdquo;
MBP &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; because it was the only MacBook at the time with the new magic
keyboard. That was a hard requirement I had. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even consider buying
a butterfly MacBook. Keyboard aside, as my &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; Mac, I did want it
to be powerful enough to be my &amp;lsquo;workstation&amp;rsquo; mac/laptop. And it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_cooling.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;the mbp had better cooling&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_cooling.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;While the 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro did improve cooling compared to it&amp;rsquo;s predecessor, it was still too warm for my tastes&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few months of use, a problem emerged regarding that power&amp;hellip; I didn&amp;rsquo;t utilize it. As I discovered
&lt;a href=&#34;../../post/sold-my-bonobo/&#34;&gt;the last time I had a more &amp;ldquo;workstation laptop&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, I
don&amp;rsquo;t like when my computers overheat and spin up their fans. The 16&amp;rdquo; macbook
was relatively thin for its specs (did you see the size of
my previous workstaion laptop!?!?). However, that sleek design came at a
cost. While the re-designed cooling on the 16&amp;rdquo; was considered quite good for
a MacBook&amp;hellip; it didn&amp;rsquo;t meet my standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_photoimport_turboboost.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Importing photos, turbo boost made temps 100c&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_photoimport_turboboost.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;While using the CPU (importing photos), the temps stayed at 80C with turbo boost disabled. After enabling it, the temps shot up to 100C!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually purchased and installed &lt;a href=&#34;http://tbswitcher.rugarciap.com&#34;&gt;turbo boost
switcher&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;em&gt;disable turbo boost on my
cpu&lt;/em&gt; This runs the cpu at it&amp;rsquo;s base clock, without boosting it up for more
&amp;lsquo;bursty&amp;rsquo; performance. This didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to hinder my small day-to-day usage,
and in my mind, was more than worth the trade to keep the computer a little
bit cooler, and prevent the fans from spinning up all the time. It was just a
shame to pay so much money for such powerful computer&amp;hellip; and then
purposefully hinder it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-m1-macs-are-released&#34;&gt;The M1 Macs are Released&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/m1_released.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Apple&#39;s M1 Announcement&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/m1_released.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Apple announced it&amp;rsquo;s first Apple Silicon CPU, the M1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in November, Apple announced the new M1 Macs, the first
computers in the company&amp;rsquo;s planned 2 transition to switch from Intel CPUs to
Apple&amp;rsquo;s own &amp;ldquo;Apple Silicon&amp;rdquo; arm processors. And they were a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was skeptical about the smoothness of a cpu architecture switch, early
reviewers indicated that Apple handled it extremely well. This had me
tempted to immediately swap my MBP in for one of the newer ones. But, I decided to
hold out for a bit, reasoning that my 16&amp;rdquo; computer was still an &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;
laptop that was more than capable of what I needed it for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the seed of questioning &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I use a mac had been planted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-use-a-mac&#34;&gt;How I use a Mac&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to map out my Mac use-cases in two broad categories: &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; I
use my mac for, and &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; I use it. After some brainstorming, I had the
following lists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-i-use-a-mac-for&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; I use a Mac For&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I most commonly use my Mac for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilizing Apple apps and services (Messages, FaceTime, Notes, Reminders,
Photos, GarageBand, Music, iCloud, Etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Browsing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Courses/Proctored Exams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH and/or VS Code (I do coding, writing, and all those other tasks on my workstation, and remote in when on my MacBook)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Planning/organizing, emails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to podcasts or music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching videos or livestreams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chatting with Friends and Family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt; a light game if I&amp;rsquo;m on the go or not at my desk (possibly streamed from my gaming VM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;where-i-use-a-macbook&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where&lt;/em&gt; I use a MacBook&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/macbook_stand.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Macbook on a stand&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/macbook_stand.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;As my main laptop, my MacBook occasionally has to serve as my portable workstation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being both my &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; Mac, as well as my main portable computer, there is
actually quite a range of &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I setup my MacBook. Some examples
include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portable: I use it as my portable machine, in a few types of locations:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sitting on the couch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At a Table, by itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At a table on a stand w/ Keyboard, and possibly other external displays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As my single portable workstation if I travel or visit family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As my Mac &amp;lsquo;desktop&amp;rsquo;, connected to all the devices at my desk via a thunderbolt hub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;best-tool-for-the-job&#34;&gt;Best Tool for the Job&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/desktop_benchmarking.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Using my macbook while running benchmarks on my desktop&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/desktop_benchmarking.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Using my MBP while running benchmarks on my desktop
after &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../post/selecting-charmeleons-upgrades/&#34;&gt;some upgrades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Dispite
its pwer, my Mac is a &lt;em&gt;secondary&lt;/em&gt; computer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A disparity stood out to me while makings these lists. I
generally try to use appropriate hardware for my need (at least within
reason). Looking over what I wrote, it felt weird to have a $2000+ laptop for
what I use it for. I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; need that much for my &lt;em&gt;secondary computer&lt;/em&gt;,
even if I loved the speakers and screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this was my &lt;em&gt;main&lt;/em&gt; computer, it would be fine. But it isn&amp;rsquo;t. I have a
&lt;a href=&#34;../../post/selecting-charmeleons-upgrades/&#34;&gt;powerful linux workstation&lt;/a&gt; for my
heavy lifting and complicated, virtual workloads. Hell, macOS isn&amp;rsquo;t even my
main OS. I do all my power-user computing on Linux&amp;hellip; even if it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; my
mac (as previously stated, I &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; into my desktop for nearly everything&amp;hellip;
including writing these posts). The MBP &lt;em&gt;met&lt;/em&gt; the role I needed it for, but
it didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily
&lt;em&gt;fit&lt;/em&gt; that role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;16-mbp-vs-air&#34;&gt;16&amp;rdquo; MBP vs. Air&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/both_macs_closed.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Both Macs, closed on table&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/both_macs_closed.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The 2019 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro and the 2020 M1 Macbook Air&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hammering out my MacBook use cases, I theorized how a M1 MacBook Air
might compare to my 16&amp;rdquo; MBP in meeting those needs. I came up with the following
conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I do occasionally use some of the mac&amp;rsquo;s heavier software (garageband,
imovie, Photos, and others), the performance of the M1 is more than enough
for what I would need it to do, and even &lt;em&gt;beats&lt;/em&gt; my Intel MBP on some tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t benefit me to wait for more powerful Apple Silicon Macs,
as my needs are already passed for what I need this device to do. Even
if an Apple Silicon 16&amp;rdquo; MBP &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; available, tempting as it might be, I&amp;rsquo;ve
already established it isn&amp;rsquo;t a good fit for this device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I would miss the screen space and speakers, the air would be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;
more portable. Not only would this be great when traveling, but it would also
be appreciated when picking it up with one hand to take into another room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dedicated GPU in the MBP doesn&amp;rsquo;t really benefit me, as I do all my
gaming in a Windows VM on my workstation. In fact, it may actually &lt;em&gt;hurt&lt;/em&gt; my
experience by generating excess heat and kicking up the fans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And on that note&amp;hellip; the air doesn&amp;rsquo;t even &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; a fan to spin up, and
doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to get too warm either. Unlike the M1 MBP, it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; throttle
to cool the CPU during sustained workloads, but we&amp;rsquo;ve already established
that I am &lt;em&gt;currently&lt;/em&gt; doing that on my 16&amp;rdquo; anyway ☺︎.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I concluded that the Air should be able to do most of the tasks my
16&amp;rdquo; MBP does, at around the same level of perfomrance, if not better. In the
case of portability and noise, the air would be &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; better suited than
my Pro. Additionally, most of the workloads the MBP &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; better at,
aren&amp;rsquo;t as important for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;decided-to-go-for-it&#34;&gt;Decided to Go for it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/trade-in-value.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Current trade-in-value&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/trade-in-value.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;I knew my trade-in value would only get worse, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to wait for the new 16&amp;rdquo; Pro to come out&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I decided to make the trade-in. My main reasons were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current trade-in price would cover the cost of the &amp;ldquo;higher end&amp;rdquo; M1
Macbook Air, and I would only have to pay tax and for any other updgrades I
wanted to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew I would slowly get less and less for my MBP. I figured once a new
16&amp;rdquo; MBP was released, the value for mine would likely plummet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I ordered the higher tier Air ( with 8gpu cores + 512GB of storage),
and bumped up the RAM to 16GB. If I was going to be be &amp;ldquo;downgrading&amp;rdquo;
from a MBP to an Air, I wanted to at least keep the same amount of RAM and
storage that I had before. It took almost a month to arrive, but now it&amp;rsquo;s
here, and I&amp;rsquo;m packing up the MBP to send back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need this secondary computer to function as my portable laptop, and only
(physical) Mac. I think the m1 air will fill both of these roles extremely
well. If I needed a laptop to be my &lt;em&gt;main&lt;/em&gt; machine&amp;hellip; I would have probably
kept the MBP and upgrade after a newer Apple Silicon version is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp16.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;My mbp.&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp16.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;My old 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2019 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro was, and still is, an amazing machine. I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; miss
it. Ultimately though, a combination of the M1 Macs being &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good, and
the fact that a smaller, thin and light laptop fit my use case best,
finalized my decision to switch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My New 16-inch Macbook Pro: Initial Thoughts</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/macos-challenge/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I &lt;em&gt;mentioned&lt;/em&gt; that I had
purchased a new 2019 16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro by the end of my macOS challenge.  I have
had the laptop for over a month now, but I made sure to take notes on some of
my initial thoughts during the first few days. Here are those thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;selection&#34;&gt;Selection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, &lt;em&gt;a word from our sponsor!&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; Just kidding. However, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to
take a minute to talk about how I selected &lt;em&gt;my first&lt;/em&gt; macbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-desk-website.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;MBP on my desk&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-desk-website.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;New 16&amp;rdquo; MBP on my desk&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While completing the macOS challenge, I decided I wanted to buy a
macbook for personal use. However, I wanted to hold out and wait to hear if the
rumors of a new scissor-switch macbook pro were true, or if I
should be considering a used 2015 Macbook Pro on eBay. Fortunately, the rumor
turned to fact, and Apple released the new 16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro. This news coupled
with a $300-off, Thanksgiving (US) sale, meant that I had a new macbook
shipping to me the first week of December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-base-model-specs&#34;&gt;The Base Model Specs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-closed.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Macbook Pro closed on the table&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-closed.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro closed on the table&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose the base-spec MBP (the cheapest one) for several reasons. First, it
saved me a bunch of money because 1) Apple upgrades tend to be expensive, and 2)
the base models can be found on sale more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the &amp;ldquo;low-end&amp;rdquo; base model specs of the 16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro were
increased to include 16 GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. This meant that it already
had everything I would normally &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to upgrade. So, the specs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- 2.6 GHz (4.5 GHz Turbo Boost) 6-Core (12 thread) i7 CPU
- 16 GB 2666MHz DDR4 RAM
- 512 GB SS
- 16&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Retina&amp;#34; display w/ True Tone
- New Keyboard design, with touchbar and Touch ID
- Four Thunderbold 3 ports
- Headphone Jack
- New speakers and mic
- Silver&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have wanted 32 GB of RAM. But if I think
about it, I &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; need RAM to run clusters of VMs&amp;hellip; which I do on Linux
workstation/servers&amp;hellip; not my laptop. So 16GB should be plenty for the needs of
&lt;em&gt;this machine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-thoughts&#34;&gt;Initial Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, now lets get to my initial thoughts. Remember, these are the
(reformatted) notes I took within about a day or so of receiving the Macbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-keyboard.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Macbook Pro from above&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-keyboard.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;I love both the new keyboard and speakers on the 16&amp;rdquo;
Macbook Pro&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keyboard&lt;/strong&gt; - Well, I’m surprised. I think I actually &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like it. The
first few minutes were a little weird, because I was used to the (2014) MacBook
Air (Also, I had been using &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-hhkb-pro2/&#34;&gt;my
HHKB&lt;/a&gt; all day). After using
it for about an hour now, I think it feels close to the air (which I like),
with &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; travel. It definitely does not have as much travel as my
Thinkpads, but it is acceptable. The keys feel like they “pop” as I type on
them, with a very satisfying bump. Overall, I very much enjoy the typing
experience. As long as it proves to be sturdy and reliable, I’d say this is
a great laptop keyboard. I am very happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trackpad&lt;/strong&gt; - Little weird at first (I had trouble sliding my fingers across
it.  I guess I needed time to oil it a bit lol), but now it seems to be working
well. It is massive, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to register accidental touches much.
Really, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much to say. It does what I need it to, basically &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the
time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen&lt;/strong&gt; - Wonderful. It’s big, bright and the colors look great. Using
the default scaling still, but actually think it’s big enough. It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful
screen large enough to get work done, on a still small-ish laptop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touch Bar&lt;/strong&gt; - Meh. It&amp;rsquo;s whatever. I have already installed better touch tool
😂. I’ll play with that later to figure out how I can switch the
audio/brightness to buttons instead of slides (the main thing I don’t like so
far), and maybe add weather. In summary, with better touch tool, I don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;mind&lt;/em&gt;
having the touch bar, but probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t miss it much if it was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt; - Amazing. Simple as that. They aren&amp;rsquo;t going to replace a
high-end pair of studio monitors, but are probably the best laptop speakers out
there, and likely better than most cheap desktop ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ports&lt;/strong&gt; - Just charging so far. I like being able to charge on
both sides. Side note: the power brick feels like an &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; brick. It is
solid and heavy, which is fine, but did surprise me a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt; - As far as I can tell, great. It seems like it can handle
most of the work loads &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; will need it for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;issues-annoyances-concerns&#34;&gt;Issues/Annoyances/Concerns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-side.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Macbook Pro from side&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-side.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;As for ports, the 16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro has two USB C/Thunderbolt3 ports and a headphone jack on one side (pictured), and 2 more USB C/Thunderbolt3 ports on the other side.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heat&lt;/strong&gt; - As I’m typing this, I do notice the metal at the top of the laptop
(above the Touch Bar) is getting quite toasty. In fact, the keys on the number
row are even a bit warm. I understand that this is where the heat is exhausted,
and that the cooling system probably relies on the aluminum body a bit as a
heat sink. I just hope it’s normal. I should note that this heat up happened
while I was installing Xcode&amp;hellip; which seems to be a beast. Once Xcode finished
installing, it did cool down fast. The entire time, the palm rest remained nice
and cool to the touch. Also, the fans never kicked up for this. So it seems
that the cooling system is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good on this laptop. I just wish it would
kick in a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bit sooner to prevent it from heating up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ports/Adaptor Annoyances&lt;/strong&gt; - Everyone is complaining that there still isn&amp;rsquo;t
an SD card reader, but honestly I could care less. I generally think having
powerful TB3 ports is a good plan, as it allows the user to craft their system
to have whatever ports &lt;em&gt;they need&lt;/em&gt;. For example, I &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; usually need an SD
card reader, but I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use USB3 and HDMI daily. With a dongle/adaptor, I can
have that, and the TB3 connector has enough bandwidth to support it. However, the
annoying part is buying into the TB3 life. I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to buy an expensive
dongle for my new expensive laptop in order to use &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; with it. Also,
the functionality of the adaptors seems to be hit or miss. I got one that
works okay, but only after having to return the first one I bought because it
just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t connect my devices. Very Annoying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrists Rest&lt;/strong&gt; - While I really enjoy the solid feel of the aluminum my
hands rest on (and how it tends to stay cool even when the computer is heating
up), the sharp edge of the laptop cuts into my wrist over time. I will admit
that this is something I have experience on other laptops too. Maybe I just
type wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The 16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro is a great all in one portable
workstation&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I love this laptop. It is powerful enough to do everything I
need, and I think Apple has done a great job addressing the complaints users
have had with Macbooks over the last few years. Considering the speaker,
microphone, keyboard, and screen upgrades this is an amazing portable
workstation. As much as I love having a full desk setup, the &amp;ldquo;built-in
periphery devices&amp;rdquo; on this laptop are &lt;em&gt;so good&lt;/em&gt;, I really don&amp;rsquo;t mind working
straight from the laptop. Which coming from &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, is saying something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Challenge - 30 Days with macOS</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/macos-challenge/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/macos-challenge/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have used many operating systems on my computers over the years, including
decades worth of Windows versions, tons of Linux distros, several BSDs, iOS,
Android, and even chromeOS. While I am familiar with using macOS
(I often used the school Macs in college, and my wife had a Macbook Air
throughout medical school), it is the one OS I have never tried as my &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt;
daily driver. After switching to an iPhone and &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/getting-an-ipad/&#34;&gt;getting an
iPad&lt;/a&gt; this year&amp;hellip; I
decided to give macOS a spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Fun fact: I first learned about Linux while attempting to Hackintosh my
laptop in high school.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a mac as the interface device during my personal computing, for 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, &amp;ldquo;interface computer&amp;rdquo; means the device that I sit at and interact with.
For example, I might be sitting at macOS and using it for my web browsing and
music, but working on a project on my linux workstation via a mosh/tmux session
in iTerm. I can use remote Linux computers as much as I please, but should
connect to them through macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that I still used Desktop Linux as my &amp;ldquo;interfacing
computer&amp;rdquo; for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind iOS and macOS teaming up to make my &amp;ldquo;normal person&amp;rdquo;
computing (web browsing, video chatting, emails, and online courses)
easier. I still deeply care about working with Linux at home, but exclusively
on the backend. So having the front end get out of the way, and not tempt me
with the ability to fine-tune it, is a good thing (&lt;em&gt;for me&lt;/em&gt;, currently).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(While I&amp;rsquo;ve slowed down &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=distrohopper&#34;&gt;distro
hopping&lt;/a&gt; the last
few years,&amp;hellip; I have still been swapping my desktop environment every other
month).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I am really only interested in using macOS for my personal
computing.  At work, I don&amp;rsquo;t need my computer to be in step with my personal
phone and/or ipad. In fact, I like having that barrier there. Also, Linux works
REALLY well for the work I do, especially when it comes to running VMs (I love
&lt;code&gt;libvirt&lt;/code&gt;). So, there currently isn&amp;rsquo;t a reason (or even a desire) to switch
there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side Note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I actually wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even consider this challenge if I didn&amp;rsquo;t
get to use Linux so much at work every day, or if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have my Linux
desktop/workstation at home. I already ssh into my desktop to work
from my other devices. In fact, I technically remote into my desktop even when
I&amp;rsquo;m working &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; it, since I do everything in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://podman.io&#34;&gt;container&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;observations&#34;&gt;Observations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a few weeks in macOS, lets break down some observations I
had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;stuff-i-didn-t-like&#34;&gt;Stuff I didn&amp;rsquo;t like&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The elephant in the room… it&amp;rsquo;s very proprietary. I still love open source and
using something that&amp;rsquo;s as locked down and secretive as macOS (and Apple
products in general) feels, well&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;dirty&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/joplin-error.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;joplin error&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/joplin-error.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Error while trying to run Joplin&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had trouble getting some applications like &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/switched-to-joplin-notes/&#34;&gt;Joplin&lt;/a&gt; to work. I later learned that it was likely due to issues with signing the applications in Catalina (I think). Apparently, there is a work-around for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There surprisingly isn’t a great solution for &lt;a href=&#34;https://virt-manager.org&#34;&gt;virt-manager&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to install it using homebrew, but have to launch it from the terminal. I guess I might be able to setup an application launcher for it? I&amp;rsquo;m just surprised there isn&amp;rsquo;t a better solution on mac, or at least one that&amp;rsquo;s easy to find&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that note, it is &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;a href=&#34;https://brew.sh&#34;&gt;brew&lt;/a&gt; exists, but it confuses the hell out of me (What&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;code&gt;cask&lt;/code&gt;? Is it like a &lt;a href=&#34;https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#group-command-label&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dnf group&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; install?). This is most likely because I am new to it, but in my opinion, I still think it is nowhere near as nice as default Linux package managers. This is one area where using Linux for so long has definitely spoiled me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with filesystems is a pain, especially when connecting to network devices. I couldn’t use Finder to do an easy network connection without first setting up samba or nfs on my Linux computers. While I ideally want to setup a proper samba/nfs server on my desktop/server in the long run anyway, it was annoying that it couldn’t just mount the system in the file browser, using something like &lt;code&gt;sftp&lt;/code&gt; under the hood like Linux does..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;video style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; controls&gt;
&lt;source src=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/network-connect.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Connecting to a remote server&amp;rsquo;s filesystem from the
file browser in Gnome (Linux)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Window management isn’t great out of the box. I had to buy &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12&#34;&gt;magnet&lt;/a&gt; to snap/tile my windows. (Alternatively for touch-bar mac users, note that &lt;a href=&#34;https://folivora.ai&#34;&gt;better touch tool&lt;/a&gt; has window snapping and other features built in). Also, I can’t seem to hold a key and click a window anywhere to resize/move like I can in most linux DEs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My desktop workspaces keep changing their order on me (ಠ_ಠ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deviating from the stock experience can become painful.  Don&amp;rsquo;t like using a global menubar, and a dock for applications?&amp;hellip; sorry?
I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are third-party ways to get around it, but they are likely
hacky and not guaranteed to always work across new versions of macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;stuff-i-liked&#34;&gt;Stuff I liked&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I  am actually starting to like the CMD-centric shortcuts. They work everywhere and are nice when working in a terminal (which I do all the time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default keybindings, while different from what I’m used to are intuitive, and consistent across the system. There are not many that are crazy. For example, on Windows/Linux systems, the keybinding to close a window usually defaults to &lt;code&gt;Alt+F4&lt;/code&gt;, so I normally change it to &lt;code&gt;Super+Shift+Q&lt;/code&gt;. While not the exact same as what I do, the macOS default of &lt;code&gt;CMD+Q&lt;/code&gt; is close enough that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to easily adapt to it, without feeling the need to figure out how to change it. It&amp;rsquo;s a similar story across most of the default keybindings. They aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly how I&amp;rsquo;ve been setting mine up, but close enough that I&amp;rsquo;m fine with accepting them as is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iCloud syncing has been nice. Specifically for photos, TODOs, and notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/phonecall.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Receiving and answering a phonecall in macOS&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/phonecall.png&#34; style=&#34;float: right; max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like being able to answer &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; phone calls from my computer.
I hate talking on the phone. Oddly
enough, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind voice chat on the computer, so this works out really
well for me. Synced iMessage and Facetime are also nice, but universal
&lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; phone calls is what I particularly enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profiles. Specifically, setting up something like my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastmail.com&#34;&gt;Fastmail&lt;/a&gt; account in the mail app
was SUPER easy because of this. I basically just downloaded the profile
from fastmail and opened it with mail, and everytihng was setup. That&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find the UI to be really space respecting. In addition to a global menu, title bars on windows are thin and minimal. Combined with scaled font sizes, a lot less space is wasted, especially compared to Gnome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/header-bar-comparison-stacked.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;macOS header bars compared to Gnome&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/header-bar-comparison-stacked.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;I find macOS to be much more space efficient than Gnome&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos just work without configuring anything/switching back and forth between Wayland and X sessions. I have faith that wayland will mature to this point eventually, but its nice to already have it in macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gestures are fluid and intuitive. Even on the old MacBook air, the trackpad
is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Settings like screentime work across all my “front-end devices”. If I set a downtime for 8:30pm, it boots me off all my devices&amp;hellip; and I get to bed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;macOS comes with a set of well-made core apps (calendar, mail, notes, music,
photos, keynote, garage band, etc). They work for everything I need. If I
want something more advanced, I generally have the full selection of open source and
proprietary apps at my disposal. For example, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Gimp just
fine on the macbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security does actually seem to be a focus on the system. For example, someone
tried to log into my icloud account from a random location the other week.
In under a minute, from my phone, I was able to unlink my account from all
my devices and change the password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;future-plans&#34;&gt;Future Plans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;rsquo;d say this challenge was a success. In fact, it was so successfull,
that I&amp;rsquo;m actually writing up this post on a new &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/&#34;&gt;base model 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook
Pro&lt;/a&gt; (but more on &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; at another time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[ Well, I&amp;rsquo;m really writing it on my desktop, but from the macbook pro ;) ]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan is to use macOS and my iOS
devices to handle my interactive/client computing. I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed having my
apple devices take care of all my &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; person computer needs over the last
few weeks. It has allowed me to finish up required, but mundane tasks easily
and efficiently, so I can better focus when diving into iTerm to work on
complicated Linux server projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I do have some reservations about this plan (mostly that my desktop Linux
skills will fade, and that I&amp;rsquo;ll loose respect in the Linux community), I don&amp;rsquo;t
think it should be too much of an issue. At the end of the day, it is most
important that I am able to spend my limited time learning and building in the
areas I want to focus on, which is back-end, rather than front-end Linux. I
want to love all technology, and be able to help people find the best solution
to their problems, no matter what they use. Maybe one day the OS flame wars
will die down and we can all just get along and build cool shit together.. Till
then, wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
