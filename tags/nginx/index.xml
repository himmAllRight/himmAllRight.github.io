      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last few months I have been working more with the open source
automation server, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins.io/&#34;&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;. While digging into
it, I have been thinking of ways to improve my home build
environment. One idea, was to utilize Jenkins to automatically build
and deploy a &amp;ldquo;draft&amp;rdquo; website, so I can stage new posts/website change
on my home network, before publishing it to the &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo;
website. Here is how that idea was Instantiated&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nginx as a Reverse Proxy to Forward Sub-Domains</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, Rebecca and I moved to Durham, North Carolina. As a
result, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to re-setup our home network. In years past, I setup
a virtual machine running &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nginx.com/&#34;&gt;Nginx&lt;/a&gt; as a
reverse-proxy (Tangela), and I decided to do that again on the new
network. While it is a simple process, it is one that other people often
ask me about. So, this time&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m taking notes!&lt;/p&gt;
