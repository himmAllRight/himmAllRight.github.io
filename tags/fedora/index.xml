      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, that was faster than I expected. This past weekend, I wiped the Fedora installation on my main computer, and replaced it with Solus. My Fedora install broke, and I needed to use a Fedora Live CD to fix it. I thought that if I had to use a live CD to fix the issue, I might as well just do a clean install. With the idea of a clean install in my head&amp;hellip; I thought (possibly influenced by my recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://ryan.himmelwright.net/posts/dabbling-with-go/#motivation&#34;&gt;motivation&lt;/a&gt; to play with Go), that I might as well do the clean install with &lt;a href=&#34;solus-project.com/&#34;&gt;Solus&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Migrating from Solus to Fedora for now</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For awhile, I have been debating the idea of switching back to Fedora (from Solus). At least on my &lt;a href=&#34;../../pages/homelab/#alakazam&#34;&gt;main computer&lt;/a&gt;. First, let me state this right up front: I am still &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; satisfied with Solus. I think it is one of the best current Linux distros, and I want to still contribute to the project. However, there are a few reasons why Solus isn&amp;rsquo;t the best fit for my needs &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, and I will highlight them below.&lt;/p&gt;
