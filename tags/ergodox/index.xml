      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past month, I have been learning to type&amp;hellip; on my new keyboard!  I
decided to purchase an &lt;a href=&#34;https://ergodox-ez.com&#34;&gt;ergodox-ex&lt;/a&gt; and have been using
it ever since. I still &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-hhkb-pro2/&#34;&gt;my HHKB&lt;/a&gt;, so why did I get
a new keyboard? And why&amp;hellip; the ergodox?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;previous-keyboard&#34;&gt;Previous Keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/got-hhkb.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Getting the HHKB
Keyboard&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/got-hhkb.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:
100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;My Happy Hacking Pro Keyboard&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a few years, I have been gladly using a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hhkeyboard.com/uk/products/pro2/&#34;&gt;Happy Hacking Pro
2&lt;/a&gt; keyboard.  Before that, I was
on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://deskthority.net/wiki/HHKB_Lite&#34;&gt;Happy Hacking Lite&lt;/a&gt;, which I
started using while in college. I love the layout of HHK and still think it&amp;rsquo;s
an amazing keyboard. The years I spent on HKBs are why I think &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; keyboard
should have &lt;code&gt;ctrl&lt;/code&gt; instead of a &lt;code&gt;caps&lt;/code&gt; key, or at least switch to two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rationale-for-a-new-one&#34;&gt;Rationale for a new one&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I love my HHKB and have no &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; complaints, there were a few things that
pushed me to start looking at new boards again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-was-getting-the-itch-to-build-one&#34;&gt;I was getting the itch to &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; one&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial motivation was the slow, growing itch to build a mechanical
keyboard.  It is an itch that I&amp;rsquo;ve felt before. I purchased my HHKB Pro as a
&lt;em&gt;backup&lt;/em&gt; plan when the order for a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://olkb.com/collections/planck&#34;&gt;planck&lt;/a&gt; keyboard kit via  mass.com was
unfortunately cancelled. My &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; intention was to learn how to solder (I
even brought a soldering iron), and build the keyboard from scratch. Ultimately buying the
HHKB, I never got to scratch that itch. While I &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; still haven&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip;
this is what had me looking at keyboards and browsing
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/&#34;&gt;/r/MechanicalKeyboards&lt;/a&gt; again in the
first place&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wanted-a-program-able-board&#34;&gt;Wanted a program-able board&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;405&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5aJ9U5t9oD4?start=557&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The keyboard firmware can be customized on some System76 laptops, as demonstrated during this review.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More important than &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; building a keyboard, I wanted to be able to
&lt;em&gt;programatically&lt;/em&gt; build it. That is to say, play with custom firmware. This is
something that my HHKB doesn&amp;rsquo;t have, but the plank did. The
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&amp;amp;c=165&#34;&gt;pok3r&lt;/a&gt;,
which I&amp;rsquo;ve considered in the past, also has programmable layers. Even some of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://system76.com/laptops&#34;&gt;System76&amp;rsquo;s laptops&lt;/a&gt; now allow the ability to
remap their keyboards using open firmware (which is awesome!). The
&lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; thing I wanted from a new keyboard was the ability to customize and
program the layers and layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;after-starting-to-learn-proper-touch-typing-i-wanted-to-try-an-ortholinear-layout&#34;&gt;After starting to learn proper touch typing, I wanted to try an ortholinear layout&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in mostly the same space for much of this year, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that my
wrists and arms have really started to tighten up. So, I put my foot down
and decided it was time once again to try and force myself to &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt;
touch type&amp;hellip; using all of my fingers. Normally, I slide my hands across the board
and have just a few fingers do the bulk of the work.  This not only creates
unnecessary movement, but also over-strains parts of my hands, building up tension
in my wrists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/touch_type_diagram.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;The Minecraft Flathub Page&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/touch_type_diagram.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Proper&amp;rsquo; finger key map for touch typing on a standard
layout&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I started typing with proper finger use, I noticed my hands &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; have a
hard time hitting some keys. Particularly the bottom row, especially with my
left hand, gave me trouble. My other fingers commonly blocked the path that the
&amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; finger needed to reach a key. It became obvious why I naturally
adapted to sliding across the board over the years. I wondered if an
ortholinear layout would better allow me to touch type properly, using all of
my fingers. My hope was that the straight grid would let my fingers
slide directly up and down to the other rows, without crossing over and
impeding my other fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-shoulder-pain-increased&#34;&gt;My shoulder pain increased&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last straw, promoting my keyboard urgency to something I &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; to order
&lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, was that my shoulder was beginning to hurt&amp;hellip; all the time. During my
search, I noticed split keyboards and thought they might
help to alleviate some of my pain. The ability to type with my arms
positioned at any width would at least allow me to vary my shoulder angle as
it got sore. So, I switched from looking at DIY kits, to pre-built split
keyboards that I could have shipped and under my fingers much quicker than I
could order and build one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;keyboard-considerations&#34;&gt;Keyboard Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With requirements decided, I started searching for my keyboard. Both of the
keyboards that I considered are made and sold from the same company,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://zsa.io&#34;&gt;ZSA&lt;/a&gt;. From what I read online, they were usually highly
recommended, with people rating both ZSA&amp;rsquo;s products and customer service very
well. Personally, I enjoyed reading about their focus on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/sustainability&#34;&gt;sustainability&lt;/a&gt; and creating open
source products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;moonlander&#34;&gt;Moonlander&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/moonlander.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;The Minecraft Flathub Page&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/moonlander.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Moonlander&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first keyboard that caught my eye was the new
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/&#34;&gt;Moonlander&lt;/a&gt;. When I first saw it, it had
&lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; been released. I admired it&amp;rsquo;s floating keys and slim profile.
Apparently, it was designed to be at least somewhat portable, as it comes with
a carrying case. The board seemed to be a fresh new take on the ergodox, with a
clever folding design and some newer features like usb-c.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;405&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mWu-_ACpSgY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to dig deep to learn anything about the moonlander as there were only a
handful of people that had them at the time. As I dug, I passively learned
more and more about the ergodox&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ergodox-ez&#34;&gt;Ergodox-EZ&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/ergodox_configurator.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;The Minecraft Flathub Page&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/ergodox_configurator.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Ergodox-EZ Configurator&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the moonlander, ZSA also builds and sells the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ergodox-ez.com&#34;&gt;ergodox-ez&lt;/a&gt; (and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck&#34;&gt;planck
ez&lt;/a&gt;, but I wanted a split board). The
ergodox-ez is a pre-built version of the well-known (to keyboard nerds&amp;hellip;),
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Ergodox-io&#34;&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt;, ortholinear, split keyboard, the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://deskthority.net/wiki/ErgoDox&#34;&gt;ergodox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the Moonlander&amp;rsquo;s features and design, but I ultimately
decided to go with the ergodox-ez for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Moonlander is brand-new and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much feedback for it
yet, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LALQsqZP1nA&#34;&gt;whereas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GPHiJMS7eo&#34;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/comfortable-ergo-keyboard/&#34;&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/03/03/why-this-300-ergonomic-keyboard-might-actually-be-worth-the-money/&#34;&gt;plenty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rtings.com/keyboard/reviews/ergodox/ez&#34;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mmorpg.com/hardware-reviews/ergodox-ez-this-is-what-powerful-looks-like-2000107228&#34;&gt;information&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://matteeyah.com/ergodox-ez-keyboard&#34;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; the ergodox-ez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, because the ergodox has been a popular design for years
now, 3rd-party parts like specialized keycaps sets
can easily be found on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mass.com/&#34;&gt;mass.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mechsupply.co.uk&#34;&gt;other
websites&lt;/a&gt;. This makes the ergodox a bit easier
to customize than the moonlander, at least currently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ergodox is great starting board for testing out the
orthlinear+split design. If there were parts of it I really hated over the
next few years, I could always switch to a moonlander or another split board that better fits my needs,
based on what I learn from the ergodox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if I instead &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the ergodox design and want &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; in a few
years for some reason, I still have the option to &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; one.. and &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt;
scratch that itch XD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a win-win situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered the Ergodox-ez and have had it for a over a month now. If you are
wondering what configuration I selected, and what I think about it so far&amp;hellip;
stay tuned for my next post ;) .&lt;/p&gt;</description>
