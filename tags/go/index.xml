      <description>While I have loved using Cryogen to create this website for over a year and a half now, I have started the transition to using another static website generator. Specifically, I have been experimenting with Hugo. This post will detail why I am switching, what I have ported over thus far, and what still needs to be completed before generating the official site with hugo.
From Cryogen to Hugo My departure from Cryogen really has nothing to do with the project itself.</description>

      <description>After spending most of this month&amp;rsquo;s dedicated learning time working on system, server, and network activities, I have been itching to start some home programming again. To motivate myself, I even considered dabbling with a new programming language&amp;hellip; and with very little internal debate, I decided to just Gopher it (I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry).
What is GO? Go (sometimes referred to as &amp;ldquo;golang&amp;rdquo;) is an open source programming language, developed in 2007 by a team at Google (Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson).</description>
