      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous post, I discussed how I sold off my System76 Bonobo laptop, and
 planned to replace it with a new computer. Well, I did&amp;hellip; awhile ago. For the
 last few months, I have been using a Lenovo T470 Thinkpad (with dock) as my new
 daily driver. Here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I start to do more with a computer on the go, the netbooks I
previously used just are not cutting it anymore. They were great for minimal
use, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t run VMs, over-heated, and didn&amp;rsquo;t have great
battery life. Now that I am going to libraries and other locations to
work on personal and open source projects, I really needed a better
mobile pc setup.&lt;/p&gt;
