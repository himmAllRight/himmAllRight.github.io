      <title>Traded my 2019 16&#34; MacBook Pro for a M1 MacBook Air</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over a year has passed since I purchased a &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/&#34;&gt;base model 2019 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook
Pro&lt;/a&gt;. My first Mac. With it&amp;rsquo;s large &amp;ldquo;retina&amp;rdquo;
display, resurrected magic keyboard, and truly &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; speakers, it might
be the most pleasurable laptop I have ever owned. However, I decided to trade
it in&amp;hellip; for a new MacBook &lt;em&gt;air&lt;/em&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mac_challenge.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Installing macOS Cataline on old air&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mac_challenge.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Installing macOS Catalina on my wife&amp;rsquo;s old MacBook Air for my Mac challenge&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Fall of 2019, I decided to do a &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/macos-challenge/&#34;&gt;30 day macOS&lt;/a&gt;
challenge. During the challenge, I learned that while I think Linux is still
my go-to and &lt;em&gt;indispensable&lt;/em&gt; OS, I did enjoy having a mac available for doing
more &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKiAnxjM8Nc&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;normal life computing&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.
Web browsing, writing emails, managing calendars, personal finance, planning
home projects with my wife, ssh&amp;rsquo;ing into servers to code&amp;hellip; that type of
stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the challenge, I decided to acquire a mac for myself. I choose the 16&amp;rdquo;
MBP &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; because it was the only MacBook at the time with the new magic
keyboard. That was a hard requirement I had. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even consider buying
a butterfly MacBook. Keyboard aside, as my &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; Mac, I did want it
to be powerful enough to be my &amp;lsquo;workstation&amp;rsquo; mac/laptop. And it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_cooling.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;the mbp had better cooling&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_cooling.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;While the 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro did improve cooling compared to it&amp;rsquo;s predecessor, it was still too warm for my tastes&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few months of use, a problem emerged regarding that power&amp;hellip; I didn&amp;rsquo;t utilize it. As I discovered
&lt;a href=&#34;../../post/sold-my-bonobo/&#34;&gt;the last time I had a more &amp;ldquo;workstation laptop&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, I
don&amp;rsquo;t like when my computers overheat and spin up their fans. The 16&amp;rdquo; macbook
was relatively thin for its specs (did you see the size of
my previous workstaion laptop!?!?). However, that sleek design came at a
cost. While the re-designed cooling on the 16&amp;rdquo; was considered quite good for
a MacBook&amp;hellip; it didn&amp;rsquo;t meet my standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_photoimport_turboboost.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Importing photos, turbo boost made temps 100c&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_photoimport_turboboost.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;While using the CPU (importing photos), the temps stayed at 80C with turbo boost disabled. After enabling it, the temps shot up to 100C!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually purchased and installed &lt;a href=&#34;http://tbswitcher.rugarciap.com&#34;&gt;turbo boost
switcher&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;em&gt;disable turbo boost on my
cpu&lt;/em&gt; This runs the cpu at it&amp;rsquo;s base clock, without boosting it up for more
&amp;lsquo;bursty&amp;rsquo; performance. This didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to hinder my small day-to-day usage,
and in my mind, was more than worth the trade to keep the computer a little
bit cooler, and prevent the fans from spinning up all the time. It was just a
shame to pay so much money for such powerful computer&amp;hellip; and then
purposefully hinder it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-m1-macs-are-released&#34;&gt;The M1 Macs are Released&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/m1_released.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Apple&#39;s M1 Announcement&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/m1_released.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Apple announced it&amp;rsquo;s first Apple Silicon CPU, the M1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in November, Apple announced the new M1 Macs, the first
computers in the company&amp;rsquo;s planned 2 transition to switch from Intel CPUs to
Apple&amp;rsquo;s own &amp;ldquo;Apple Silicon&amp;rdquo; arm processors. And they were a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was skeptical about the smoothness of a cpu architecture switch, early
reviewers indicated that Apple handled it extremely well. This had me
tempted to immediately swap my MBP in for one of the newer ones. But, I decided to
hold out for a bit, reasoning that my 16&amp;rdquo; computer was still an &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;
laptop that was more than capable of what I needed it for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the seed of questioning &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I use a mac had been planted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-use-a-mac&#34;&gt;How I use a Mac&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to map out my Mac use-cases in two broad categories: &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; I
use my mac for, and &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; I use it. After some brainstorming, I had the
following lists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-i-use-a-mac-for&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; I use a Mac For&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I most commonly use my Mac for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilizing Apple apps and services (Messages, FaceTime, Notes, Reminders,
Photos, GarageBand, Music, iCloud, Etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Browsing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Courses/Proctored Exams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH and/or VS Code (I do coding, writing, and all those other tasks on my workstation, and remote in when on my MacBook)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Planning/organizing, emails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to podcasts or music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching videos or livestreams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chatting with Friends and Family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt; a light game if I&amp;rsquo;m on the go or not at my desk (possibly streamed from my gaming VM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;where-i-use-a-macbook&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where&lt;/em&gt; I use a MacBook&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/macbook_stand.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Macbook on a stand&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/macbook_stand.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;As my main laptop, my MacBook occasionally has to serve as my portable workstation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being both my &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; Mac, as well as my main portable computer, there is
actually quite a range of &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I setup my MacBook. Some examples
include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portable: I use it as my portable machine, in a few types of locations:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sitting on the couch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At a Table, by itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At a table on a stand w/ Keyboard, and possibly other external displays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As my single portable workstation if I travel or visit family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As my Mac &amp;lsquo;desktop&amp;rsquo;, connected to all the devices at my desk via a thunderbolt hub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;best-tool-for-the-job&#34;&gt;Best Tool for the Job&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/desktop_benchmarking.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Using my macbook while running benchmarks on my desktop&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/desktop_benchmarking.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Using my MBP while running benchmarks on my desktop
after &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../post/selecting-charmeleons-upgrades/&#34;&gt;some upgrades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Dispite
its pwer, my Mac is a &lt;em&gt;secondary&lt;/em&gt; computer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A disparity stood out to me while makings these lists. I
generally try to use appropriate hardware for my need (at least within
reason). Looking over what I wrote, it felt weird to have a $2000+ laptop for
what I use it for. I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; need that much for my &lt;em&gt;secondary computer&lt;/em&gt;,
even if I loved the speakers and screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this was my &lt;em&gt;main&lt;/em&gt; computer, it would be fine. But it isn&amp;rsquo;t. I have a
&lt;a href=&#34;../../post/selecting-charmeleons-upgrades/&#34;&gt;powerful linux workstation&lt;/a&gt; for my
heavy lifting and complicated, virtual workloads. Hell, macOS isn&amp;rsquo;t even my
main OS. I do all my power-user computing on Linux&amp;hellip; even if it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; my
mac (as previously stated, I &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; into my desktop for nearly everything&amp;hellip;
including writing these posts). The MBP &lt;em&gt;met&lt;/em&gt; the role I needed it for, but
it didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily
&lt;em&gt;fit&lt;/em&gt; that role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;16-mbp-vs-air&#34;&gt;16&amp;rdquo; MBP vs. Air&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/both_macs_closed.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Both Macs, closed on table&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/both_macs_closed.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The 2019 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro and the 2020 M1 Macbook Air&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hammering out my MacBook use cases, I theorized how a M1 MacBook Air
might compare to my 16&amp;rdquo; MBP in meeting those needs. I came up with the following
conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I do occasionally use some of the mac&amp;rsquo;s heavier software (garageband,
imovie, Photos, and others), the performance of the M1 is more than enough
for what I would need it to do, and even &lt;em&gt;beats&lt;/em&gt; my Intel MBP on some tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t benefit me to wait for more powerful Apple Silicon Macs,
as my needs are already passed for what I need this device to do. Even
if an Apple Silicon 16&amp;rdquo; MBP &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; available, tempting as it might be, I&amp;rsquo;ve
already established it isn&amp;rsquo;t a good fit for this device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I would miss the screen space and speakers, the air would be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;
more portable. Not only would this be great when traveling, but it would also
be appreciated when picking it up with one hand to take into another room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dedicated GPU in the MBP doesn&amp;rsquo;t really benefit me, as I do all my
gaming in a Windows VM on my workstation. In fact, it may actually &lt;em&gt;hurt&lt;/em&gt; my
experience by generating excess heat and kicking up the fans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And on that note&amp;hellip; the air doesn&amp;rsquo;t even &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; a fan to spin up, and
doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to get too warm either. Unlike the M1 MBP, it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; throttle
to cool the CPU during sustained workloads, but we&amp;rsquo;ve already established
that I am &lt;em&gt;currently&lt;/em&gt; doing that on my 16&amp;rdquo; anyway ☺︎.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I concluded that the Air should be able to do most of the tasks my
16&amp;rdquo; MBP does, at around the same level of perfomrance, if not better. In the
case of portability and noise, the air would be &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; better suited than
my Pro. Additionally, most of the workloads the MBP &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; better at,
aren&amp;rsquo;t as important for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;decided-to-go-for-it&#34;&gt;Decided to Go for it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/trade-in-value.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Current trade-in-value&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/trade-in-value.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;I knew my trade-in value would only get worse, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to wait for the new 16&amp;rdquo; Pro to come out&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I decided to make the trade-in. My main reasons were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current trade-in price would cover the cost of the &amp;ldquo;higher end&amp;rdquo; M1
Macbook Air, and I would only have to pay tax and for any other updgrades I
wanted to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew I would slowly get less and less for my MBP. I figured once a new
16&amp;rdquo; MBP was released, the value for mine would likely plummet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I ordered the higher tier Air ( with 8gpu cores + 512GB of storage),
and bumped up the RAM to 16GB. If I was going to be be &amp;ldquo;downgrading&amp;rdquo;
from a MBP to an Air, I wanted to at least keep the same amount of RAM and
storage that I had before. It took almost a month to arrive, but now it&amp;rsquo;s
here, and I&amp;rsquo;m packing up the MBP to send back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need this secondary computer to function as my portable laptop, and only
(physical) Mac. I think the m1 air will fill both of these roles extremely
well. If I needed a laptop to be my &lt;em&gt;main&lt;/em&gt; machine&amp;hellip; I would have probably
kept the MBP and upgrade after a newer Apple Silicon version is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp16.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;My mbp.&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp16.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;My old 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2019 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro was, and still is, an amazing machine. I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; miss
it. Ultimately though, a combination of the M1 Macs being &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good, and
the fact that a smaller, thin and light laptop fit my use case best,
finalized my decision to switch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Selecting Charmeleon&#39;s Upgrades</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/selecting-charmeleons-upgrades/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/selecting-charmeleons-upgrades/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After months of planning and price tracking, I have finished upgrading
several major components in my Linux workstation. What started
as a planned cpu and ram upgrade, eventually ballooned to also include a new
motherboard and a secondary gpu. Let me explain&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/selecting-charmeleon-upgrades/pre_upgrades.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Inside charmeleon before upgrades&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/selecting-charmeleon-upgrades/pre_upgrades.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Charmeleon Internals before the upgrades&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over two years ago, I &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/charmeleon-desktop-design/&#34;&gt;built and designed
charmeleon&lt;/a&gt;, my Linux desktop computer. In
that post, I explained how I wanted to upgrade charmeleon over time, and
designed it with that in mind. Since the initial build, I have only made a
few minor enhancements: I added a nvme ssd and &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/rx580-upgrade/&#34;&gt;upgraded the
gpu&lt;/a&gt; after the original one stopped working. The next
change I hoped to make was adding more RAM. However, as I started down that path,
things became a bit more&amp;hellip; complicated&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-selection&#34;&gt;Part Selection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ram&#34;&gt;RAM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/selecting-charmeleon-upgrades/ripjaws_ram.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Two 32GB sticks of DDR4 3200 ram in&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/selecting-charmeleon-upgrades/ripjaws_ram.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:
100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;RAM upgrade: 2x32 GB of 3200Mhz DDR4, CL 16&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An easy upgrade I prepared for during the inital build was RAM. My
motherboard had 4 slots with a max capacity of 64GB. So, I made sure to
populate it with 2x16gb sticks instead of 4x8gb ones, so the capacity could
be effortlessly doubled when RAM became cheaper. But, the release of Ryzen
3000 cpus changed things. Overnight, a Ryzen 3000 serries processor paired
with my motherboard could support up to 128gb of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me wonder if I should instead fill those blank spaces with the
&lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; max dimm size sticks. The only problem was, if I wanted to upgrade RAM
to the new max size, I also needed to upgrade to a newer CPU. Oh, and also
buy twice the anticipated capacity of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoiler alert: I did also buy a new cpu. More on that below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I settled on a Ripjaws V 2x32GB 3200Mhz kit with 16-18-18-38
timings. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t a 2x32gb pair that matched the model of my original
RAM, and but this one had all the same timings while still being cheaper than
other alternatives. A total of 96GB of RAM is definitely overkill for most
uses (arguably, even my own). However, I tend to run large, automated VM
deployments and often use my &lt;code&gt;/tmp/&lt;/code&gt; dir as a large working folder, so the
extra overhead is nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; I always planned to expand my RAM. Ryzen 3000 allowed an even higher
max RAM capacity with my MB, but I would have to also upgrade my CPU. I upgraded both,
and now have 96GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cpu&#34;&gt;CPU&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/selecting-charmeleon-upgrades/ryzen9_box.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Ryzen 9 3900x Box&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/selecting-charmeleon-upgrades/ryzen9_box.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:
100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;CPU upgrade: Ryzen 9 3900x, 12 core/24 thread cpu&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;em&gt;origonal&lt;/em&gt; plan when I built charmeleon was to get the 2600, and later
upgrade to a 8 core 2700x or a 3000 cpu that was rumored to potentially have
even more cores. I made sure my motherboard had good VRMs for the cost, so it
could support a future upgrade with more cores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months later the 3000 cpus launched, and I was set on getting a 3900x.
However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a new cpu yet and I knew AMD was going to be releasing
the &amp;ldquo;4000&amp;rdquo; cpus in the Fall. I figured I would wait until they were
released, and then buy a new one, or a discounted 3000 serries one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the 5000 series cpus were released, I thought the 5900x would be
perfect. Unfortunately, like ever other tech release of 2020, it was nearly
impossible to buy one. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like waiting even longer, and I don&amp;rsquo;t
actually &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; the increased performance. The new gains are particularly
observed in gamming&amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;m rocking an rx580 and am clearly gpu bottlenecked
anyway 😆. I can &lt;em&gt;manage&lt;/em&gt; just fine with slower single core speeds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the 5900x not available anytime soon, I became tempted by some
crazier options&amp;hellip; like the 3950x. The 3950x is an amazing cpu, and honestly
I&amp;rsquo;d still love to have one. However, even if I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; get it on sale&amp;hellip; I
knew it would still cost a ton and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t justify the price difference. While a
16 core cpu is amazing, a 12 core still easily covers my needs. The money
&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;saved&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; on the price difference could then be used to get the bigger ram
upgrade I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I looked back at the 3900x and wondered if it would go on sale. It did
occasionally, but seemed like there might start to be shortage issues with
people jumping to &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; after not being able to get a 5900x. The next time I
saw it go on sale, I snagged one just as they sold out again. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get it
for the cheapest it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; been, but the sale was quite close to the all
time low. And it was &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; cheaper than what it has remained at ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; I planned to upgrade to a higher core count CPU. After
waiting, I wanted a 5900x, but you can&amp;rsquo;t buy them. After being tempted by the
3950x, I purchased the more reasonably priced 3900x on sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cpu-cooler&#34;&gt;CPU Cooler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/selecting-charmeleon-upgrades/noctua_box.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Noctua nh-u14s box&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/selecting-charmeleon-upgrades/noctua_box.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;CPU Cooler upgrade: Noctua NH-U14s&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the summer I upgraded all the fans in my case to Noctua ones and love
them. At the time, I wanted to also get a new cpu cooler to match, but with plans
to upgrade my cpu soon, I figured I would wait and order both at the same time so
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to go through the hassel of repasting the CPU twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I switched what specific model I wanted once or twice, after being confused
about compatibility. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want the massive NH-D15, but did want a cooler
that used a 140mm fans instead of 120mm ones, because I much prefer their
lower sounding &amp;ldquo;woosh&amp;rdquo;. After I confirmed it should fit in the Meshify C and
with my RAM, I selected the NH-U14s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; I wanted a new CPU Cooler with a 140mm fan. I love Noctua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;motherboard&#34;&gt;Motherboard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/selecting-charmeleon-upgrades/mb_box.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;x570 Aorus Elite Wifi Box&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/selecting-charmeleon-upgrades/mb_box.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Motherboard upgrade: x570 Aorus Elite Wifi&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the CPU and RAM, I never intended to get a new motherboard when
building Charmeleon. When I was looking at getting a 5000s cpu, I knew my
B450 thomahawk wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get the required bios upgrade until January&amp;hellip; maybe.
I also knew the upgrade might not be reversable which I didn&amp;rsquo;t like, so I
started to look at B550 and x570 boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized x570 fit my needs a bit better when compared to my b450, and even
the new b550 (which I think &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people should probably get). The x570
paired well with the other upgrades I was making. Particular features I liked
compared to the b450 tomahawk were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gen4 PCIe support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better iommu groupings for VFIO passthrough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often had a second m.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More &lt;em&gt;usable&lt;/em&gt; sata ports (2 of mine were disabled because they shared lanes with my m.2),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wifi (mostly for bluetooth)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, more pcie lanes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at mother boards for months while waiting for Ryzen 5000 to
officially be announced. I decided that I wanted a x570 Gigabyte Aorus board, but
wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure which one. The Aorus Master seemed to be one of &lt;em&gt;the defacto
recommend&lt;/em&gt; boards for VFIO builds, but it was very expensive. Much of what made
it so good however for iommu seemed to still be present in the cheaper Aorus models. In
particular, the Aorus boards had great iommu groupings and support,
&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a bios feature that allows you select which x16 slot to use for the
primary gpu. This makes it easier to boot into a secondary gpu, saving the
beefier one to pass through to VMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back and forth trying to decide between the elite wifi, pro, ultra&amp;hellip;
and sometimes even the master, for weeks. When I started making
purchases, the elite wifi went on sale and I decided to grab it. It had
everything I needed, and most of the upgraded features on the other boards I
either wouldn&amp;rsquo;t use or were just small nice to haves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; Looking at Ryzen 5000 CPUs had me looking at newer motherboards.
Even after dropping back down to a 3000 CPU, I still wanted a motherboard
upgrade for better VFIO support and expandability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;gpu&#34;&gt;GPU&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/selecting-charmeleon-upgrades/gpu_box.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;rx550 box&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/selecting-charmeleon-upgrades/gpu_box.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Second GPU: RX 550 4GB&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a motherboard that better supported vfio passthrough, I wanted to get a
smaller gpu that I could use for host machine&amp;rsquo;s graphics. I read that the rx550 and
1030gt were both good, sub $100 gpus often used for the host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thrilled about using a nvida gpu on a linux host, but I loved how
small it was (although that could translate more fan moise). In comparison,
the 550 seemed to be slightly more powerful, was amd, and well rated. In
fact, I had read several gpu passthrough guides using the rx550 and passing
through a rx580 (my current gpu). I purchased the 550.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; I wanted an easier time with VFIO GPU passthrough. Having a second
card for the host or a second VM makes this easier. The rx550 is a common card
for this use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/selecting-charmeleon-upgrades/post_upgrades.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Inside charmeleon after upgrades&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/selecting-charmeleon-upgrades/post_upgrades.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Charmeleon Internals after upgrades&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy with my selections. It&amp;rsquo;s surreal how powerful of a
machine can be built with a modest budget these days. With the upgrades,
Charmelon&amp;rsquo;s specs now stand at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ryzen 9 3900x [3.8 GHz (4.6GHz Boost), 12 Cores, 24 Threads)
Noctua NH-U14s CPU Cooler
Aorus Elite Wifi x570 Motherboard
96 GB (2x16GB, 2x32GB) DDR4-3200 Mhz, CL 16 RAM
Sapphire Radeon Pulse RX 580 8GB GPU
Sapphire Radeon Pulse RX 550 4GB GPU
500 GB Samsung 970 EVO NVME SSD
500 GB Samsung 850 EVO SATA SSD
120 GB Kingston SSD (Dedicated windows VM)
EVGA SuperNOVA G4 650w 80+ Gold, fully modular PSU
Fractal Design Meshify C Dark TG ATX Mid Tower Case
2 x Noctua NF-A14 PWM 140mm Fans
1 x Noctua NF-F12 PWM 120mm Fan
Fedora 33 (KDE Plasma)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only have these changes drastically improved the performance of my
workstation, but they have allowed me to run virtual machines at the next
level. When passing hardware directly to my VMs, I cannot tell that the
computer I&amp;rsquo;m sitting at is virtualized. I have been living inside Vms, and I
love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it! I still want to get a second nvme sdd, but other than that I think
upgrades to Charmeleon will slow down for a bit&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My new Ergox-EZ Keyboard -- Initial Thoughts</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/ergodox-ez-initial-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/ergodox-ez-initial-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Several weeks ago, I wrote about how I &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/decided-to-get-an-ergodox/&#34;&gt;decided to purchase an
ergodox-ez&lt;/a&gt; split keyboard. In that
post, I omitted any details about what configuration I ordered,
as well my impressions about the board. Now that I have been an
ergodox owner for&amp;hellip; wow, over two months&amp;hellip; I guess this post is
due. Here are my &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;initial&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; thoughts of the ergodox-ez&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ordering-and-shipping&#34;&gt;Ordering and shipping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/both_boxes.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The Boxes my ergdox came in&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/both_boxes.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:
100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The boxes the ergodox-ez shipped in&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what ergodox did I order? After a few hours toggling the
configuration tool and endless internal debating, I eventually settled on an
ergodox-ez &lt;em&gt;glow&lt;/em&gt; (backlit keys), with a black body, and black printed, LED
compatible, key caps.  With a narrowed selection of switch options (to maintain
backlit key compatibility), I landed on Cherry MX Browns as my best choice. I
wanted a noticeable tactile bump, but didn&amp;rsquo;t want &amp;ldquo;click-y&amp;rdquo; keys. I prefer a
lower &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Clack&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, while typing and find the higher pitch of MX Blues annoying.
I decided that I might as well go all in with this keyboard, so I ordered the
tenting poles and black wrist rests as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With everything decided, I placed my order and prepared myself to wait
in anticipated glee for&amp;hellip; an average of 3 weeks shipping time ಠ_ಠ. &lt;em&gt;Luckily&lt;/em&gt;,
I was fortunate and about a week later, I had a large, flat box show up at my
door!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_box_plastic.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Opened the ergodox box&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_box_plastic.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Opening the main box&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything was very well packaged. The keyboard came in one box, and the wrist
rests had their own. The two boxes had the same width, so they could be shipped
as one unit. Lifting the lid on the larger box, I was greeted by the keyboard
looking back at me through a plastic panel, with it&amp;rsquo;s accessories (cables, key
switch puller, screws) neatly pinned around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;setup&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; setup was quite simple. I took everything out of the
box, connected the two halves of the board together with the included TRRS
cable, and then used the mini usb cable (also included) to connect right half
of the board to my laptop&amp;rsquo;s usb port. I positioned the wrist-rests and tweaked
the tenting poles to some arbitrary position, acting as if I knew what I was
doing.  That was it. After that point, I was able to type&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; into my
computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-layout-changes&#34;&gt;Initial Layout Changes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_defalut_layout.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The ergodox default layout&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_default_layout.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The default ergodox layout&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt;, because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to just pick up the board
and feel 100% comfortable like one might with a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;
keyboard. There was definitely a learning curve (more on that later).  However,
the main problem was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know the &lt;em&gt;default layout&lt;/em&gt;. The
back-lit QWERTY keys were labeled, but all of the modifier keys on the sides
and in the thumb clusters were not. So, I navigated online to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/oryx&#34;&gt;oryx
configurator&lt;/a&gt; with two goals in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To learn the standard layout that the board shipped with, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To alter some of the defaults with changes I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; I would want (caps lock as a ctrl, for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of scanning and tweaking, I had my first layout to flash.
I downloaded the file&amp;hellip; and ran into my only &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; issue I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced with the
ergodox&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;issues-with-wally&#34;&gt;Issues with Wally&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_macbook.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Using the ergodox with my Macbook Pro&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_macbook.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:
100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Using the ergodox-ez with my MacBook Pro&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was able to flash the firmware using my macbook, for some reason my
Fedora laptops and desktop had issues at first. I would open up
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/wally&#34;&gt;wally&lt;/a&gt; (ZSA&amp;rsquo;s firmware flashing tool), load the
firmware file, and press the tiny &amp;lsquo;reset&amp;rsquo; button on my keyboard with a
paper-clip&amp;hellip; and it would freeze. The back lights stopped their colorful
dancing and key presses rendered no response. The only way
to get the board to respond again was to unplug and replug it back in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had heard that ZSA had good customer support, so I emailed them about my problem.
They responded right away and helped to debug what might be happening.  It
appeared to be some sort of permissions issue, although to this day I&amp;rsquo;m not
100% sure what it actually was. Eventually, it started working. Since then I
have updated most of my computers to Fedora 33, and I use a newer version of
Wally. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had trouble since, even on fresh OS installs. It just works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well, problem resolved I guess? My main takeaways from the experience were
that 1) wally definitely requires &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; root permissions, and 2) that ZSA&amp;rsquo;s customer
support is wonderful.  Oh, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zsa/wally&#34;&gt;open source
firmware&lt;/a&gt; is the best, but I already knew that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: ZSA has since updated the Linux README instructions to contain the udev
instructions they gave me)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-used-to-and-learning-the-board&#34;&gt;Getting used to and learning the board&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously stated, I knew I would have to put some effort into learning how
to type on the ergodox. When I got it, I did a fair bit of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.keybr.com&#34;&gt;typing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.typeracer.com/&#34;&gt;practice&lt;/a&gt; and
used it for work everyday. Within a few days, I was at a passable typing speed,
and after a few more, and I reached a &lt;em&gt;decent&lt;/em&gt; speed. I am not sure if I am any
&lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt; than on my old keyboard, but I can type fast for much longer (I
could only burst speed-type on the HHKB before starting to cramp up, mostly due to
poor form).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/oryx_trainer.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Oryx Training Tool&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/oryx_trainer.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Oryx Training Tool&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t done any typing practice the last few weeks and I&amp;rsquo;ve started to
notice &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of my bad habits creeping back in. I want to start up
again and might try to use the trainer that is included in the Oryx tool. It is
able to connect to the keyboard to show your layout, and provides several types
of content to type through (code, books, symbols). I might use it to
help determine an optimized coding layer places my most used symbols in easy to
reach places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-like&#34;&gt;What I like&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;customizability&#34;&gt;Customizability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This board is fully customizable on both the hardware &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; software side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;firmware&#34;&gt;Firmware&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_layout.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Ergodox layout&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_layout.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;One of my custom layer layouts&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to tweak the layout of multiple layers means there are an endless
amount of ways I can tailor my keyboard to fit my needs. My tweaking has
slowed down a bit, but I love that I can make quick changes to my layout if I
decide there is a better way to do something. For example, today I realized I wanted to add
a key on one of my alternate layers, so I popped open oryx and wally, and had
the change finished in about a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having an open firmware keyboard is reminiscent of when I &lt;a href=&#34;http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/back-on-arch/&#34;&gt;used vanilla arch
linux&lt;/a&gt;. I would go weeks
assuming I had everything required for a typical desktop environment, when all
of sudden, I would try to open a pdf and realize I never installed a pdf
reader&amp;hellip; or a &lt;em&gt;file browser&lt;/em&gt;. Last week while working, I noticed that
my ergodox layout didn&amp;rsquo;t have a &amp;lsquo;delete&amp;rsquo; key. So I quickly added one. Done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: Be aware that I haven&amp;rsquo;t even touched on the advanced layout options,
like macros and long vs short key presses)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;hardware&#34;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/key_switches.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Key switches&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/key_switches.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:
100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Testing swapping out a switch with one from my switch
tester&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the firmware, It&amp;rsquo;s nice to know that there is quite a bit I can
    &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; change about my keyboard. Specifically, the key caps can be
    changed and the switches themselves are hot-swappable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve already looked around for some of the parts I could swap out on my board
in a few years if I want to mix things up. For example, I am interesting in
swapping to mx clear switches someday. The problem with clears is the lights
would not (ironically) shine through anymore. I guess that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too big
of an issue though, because many of the alternative key caps I like are opaque
ツ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anyway&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; Despite talking about all the hardware upgrades I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; make, I
actually do enjoy it&amp;rsquo;s current configuration. But I do love that I have the
option to change it over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ortholinear&#34;&gt;Ortholinear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it was more difficult to get used to than I expected, I have found using
an orthlinear layout to be considerably easier to type on. My fingers no longer
fight and trip over each other like Black-Friday shoppers trying to grab the
last hot-ticket item. The &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; thing about using an ortholinear layout is
that I now want it to become a standard option when buying laptops: ISO or ANSI,
Ortho or Staggard? Unfortunately I don&amp;rsquo;t see that happening anytime soon&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;split-design&#34;&gt;Split Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/laptop_stand.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Ergodox around a laptop stand&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/laptop_stand.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:
100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;A split design keyboard pairs nicely with a laptop stand.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the ortholinear layout, a fully split keyboard is a considerable
ergonomic boost.  I can lay my arms on the desk in whichever way is most
comfortable&amp;hellip; and then position the keyboard to match &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, the split design pairs nicely with laptop stands, allowing me to
slide the stand closer. This makes it easier to view smaller screens at a

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_wood.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;ergodox on wood desk&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_wood.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:

&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The thumb cluster of keys has allowed me to better utilize my thumbs, which has been a nice change&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature I immediately miss on other keyboards, is thumb keys. It is a
relief to provide my thumbs control over more keys than just the spacebar. The
thumb clusters enable me to offload responsibility for backspace, tab, enter,
delete, and a few other keys from my weakest fingers (pinkies), to my strongest
(thumbs). This makes a huge difference while typing, but is probably the
biggest difficulty I have when switching to a laptop keyboard from my ergodox.
I keep finding myself smashing the spacebar when trying to backspace or enter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-don-t-love&#34;&gt;What I don&amp;rsquo;t love&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, there is not much that I don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; about the ergodox-ez. That
being said, if forced to be picky, here is a thing or two that I don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;
about it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning-curve&#34;&gt;Learning curve&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/typing_test.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;typing test results&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/typing_test.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Results from one of my typing practices&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest con to getting a keyboard like the ergodox is the learning curve.
It isn&amp;rsquo;t something that you will be able to pick up and immediately start
using.  It will require time and deliberate daily practice to really start to
feel comfortable. If you know this when purchasing, it isn&amp;rsquo;t that big of a
problem, but can be extremely frustrating at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cost&#34;&gt;Cost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is expensive. Especially for a unique board that you might end up hating.
With that said, if the ergodox works for you, the cost isn&amp;rsquo;t as bad as it might
initially appear.  The ergodox-ez is a solid board, with the
ability to customize both it&amp;rsquo;s hardware and firmware over a span of many years.
On top of that, when compared to &lt;a href=&#34;https://kinesis-ergo.com/products/#advantage2&#34;&gt;other &amp;lsquo;ergonomic&amp;rsquo; split
keyboards&lt;/a&gt;, the ergodox is
priced rather fairly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-s-difficult-to-switch-back-to-my-hhkb&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to switch back to my HHKB&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switching to keyboards on my laptops is mostly fine, but for whatever
reason &amp;hellip; I can&amp;rsquo;t type on my HHKB. It feels so squished, and I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to
naturally position my fingers on the correct keys anymore. I&amp;rsquo;m sure if I
dedicate a few hours to using the HHKB this might go away, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t done
that yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_office.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The ergodox in my home office&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/ergodox_office.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:
100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The ergodox-ez in my home office&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I love this keyboard and am very satisfied with my choice. Now that I am used
to it, it feels normal to type on and I don&amp;rsquo;t have to think about it.
The Split design and ortholinear layout make it the most natural feeling
and comfortable board I have used. As a bonus, any layout issues can be stomped
out with a 2 minute config change and flash, ensuring that I should &lt;em&gt;continue&lt;/em&gt;
to love this board even as my preferences change. As long as you are aware of
what you are getting into, I highly recommend the ergodox-ez.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Decided to get an Ergodox</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/decided-to-get-an-ergodox/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past month, I have been learning to type&amp;hellip; on my new keyboard!  I
decided to purchase an &lt;a href=&#34;https://ergodox-ez.com&#34;&gt;ergodox-ex&lt;/a&gt; and have been using
it ever since. I still &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-hhkb-pro2/&#34;&gt;my HHKB&lt;/a&gt;, so why did I get
a new keyboard? And why&amp;hellip; the ergodox?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;previous-keyboard&#34;&gt;Previous Keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/got-hhkb.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Getting the HHKB
Keyboard&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/got-hhkb.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:
100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;My Happy Hacking Pro Keyboard&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a few years, I have been gladly using a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hhkeyboard.com/uk/products/pro2/&#34;&gt;Happy Hacking Pro
2&lt;/a&gt; keyboard.  Before that, I was
on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://deskthority.net/wiki/HHKB_Lite&#34;&gt;Happy Hacking Lite&lt;/a&gt;, which I
started using while in college. I love the layout of HHK and still think it&amp;rsquo;s
an amazing keyboard. The years I spent on HKBs are why I think &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; keyboard
should have &lt;code&gt;ctrl&lt;/code&gt; instead of a &lt;code&gt;caps&lt;/code&gt; key, or at least switch to two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rationale-for-a-new-one&#34;&gt;Rationale for a new one&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I love my HHKB and have no &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; complaints, there were a few things that
pushed me to start looking at new boards again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-was-getting-the-itch-to-build-one&#34;&gt;I was getting the itch to &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; one&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial motivation was the slow, growing itch to build a mechanical
keyboard.  It is an itch that I&amp;rsquo;ve felt before. I purchased my HHKB Pro as a
&lt;em&gt;backup&lt;/em&gt; plan when the order for a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://olkb.com/collections/planck&#34;&gt;planck&lt;/a&gt; keyboard kit via  mass.com was
unfortunately cancelled. My &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; intention was to learn how to solder (I
even brought a soldering iron), and build the keyboard from scratch. Ultimately buying the
HHKB, I never got to scratch that itch. While I &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; still haven&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip;
this is what had me looking at keyboards and browsing
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/&#34;&gt;/r/MechanicalKeyboards&lt;/a&gt; again in the
first place&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wanted-a-program-able-board&#34;&gt;Wanted a program-able board&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;405&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5aJ9U5t9oD4?start=557&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The keyboard firmware can be customized on some System76 laptops, as demonstrated during this review.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More important than &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; building a keyboard, I wanted to be able to
&lt;em&gt;programatically&lt;/em&gt; build it. That is to say, play with custom firmware. This is
something that my HHKB doesn&amp;rsquo;t have, but the plank did. The
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&amp;amp;c=165&#34;&gt;pok3r&lt;/a&gt;,
which I&amp;rsquo;ve considered in the past, also has programmable layers. Even some of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://system76.com/laptops&#34;&gt;System76&amp;rsquo;s laptops&lt;/a&gt; now allow the ability to
remap their keyboards using open firmware (which is awesome!). The
&lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; thing I wanted from a new keyboard was the ability to customize and
program the layers and layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;after-starting-to-learn-proper-touch-typing-i-wanted-to-try-an-ortholinear-layout&#34;&gt;After starting to learn proper touch typing, I wanted to try an ortholinear layout&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in mostly the same space for much of this year, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that my
wrists and arms have really started to tighten up. So, I put my foot down
and decided it was time once again to try and force myself to &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt;
touch type&amp;hellip; using all of my fingers. Normally, I slide my hands across the board
and have just a few fingers do the bulk of the work.  This not only creates
unnecessary movement, but also over-strains parts of my hands, building up tension
in my wrists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/touch_type_diagram.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;The Minecraft Flathub Page&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/touch_type_diagram.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Proper&amp;rsquo; finger key map for touch typing on a standard
layout&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I started typing with proper finger use, I noticed my hands &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; have a
hard time hitting some keys. Particularly the bottom row, especially with my
left hand, gave me trouble. My other fingers commonly blocked the path that the
&amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; finger needed to reach a key. It became obvious why I naturally
adapted to sliding across the board over the years. I wondered if an
ortholinear layout would better allow me to touch type properly, using all of
my fingers. My hope was that the straight grid would let my fingers
slide directly up and down to the other rows, without crossing over and
impeding my other fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-shoulder-pain-increased&#34;&gt;My shoulder pain increased&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last straw, promoting my keyboard urgency to something I &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; to order
&lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, was that my shoulder was beginning to hurt&amp;hellip; all the time. During my
search, I noticed split keyboards and thought they might
help to alleviate some of my pain. The ability to type with my arms
positioned at any width would at least allow me to vary my shoulder angle as
it got sore. So, I switched from looking at DIY kits, to pre-built split
keyboards that I could have shipped and under my fingers much quicker than I
could order and build one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;keyboard-considerations&#34;&gt;Keyboard Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With requirements decided, I started searching for my keyboard. Both of the
keyboards that I considered are made and sold from the same company,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://zsa.io&#34;&gt;ZSA&lt;/a&gt;. From what I read online, they were usually highly
recommended, with people rating both ZSA&amp;rsquo;s products and customer service very
well. Personally, I enjoyed reading about their focus on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/sustainability&#34;&gt;sustainability&lt;/a&gt; and creating open
source products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;moonlander&#34;&gt;Moonlander&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/moonlander.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;The Minecraft Flathub Page&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/moonlander.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Moonlander&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first keyboard that caught my eye was the new
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/&#34;&gt;Moonlander&lt;/a&gt;. When I first saw it, it had
&lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; been released. I admired it&amp;rsquo;s floating keys and slim profile.
Apparently, it was designed to be at least somewhat portable, as it comes with
a carrying case. The board seemed to be a fresh new take on the ergodox, with a
clever folding design and some newer features like usb-c.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;405&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mWu-_ACpSgY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to dig deep to learn anything about the moonlander as there were only a
handful of people that had them at the time. As I dug, I passively learned
more and more about the ergodox&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ergodox-ez&#34;&gt;Ergodox-EZ&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/ergodox_configurator.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;The Minecraft Flathub Page&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/decided_to_get_an_ergodox/ergodox_configurator.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Ergodox-EZ Configurator&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the moonlander, ZSA also builds and sells the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ergodox-ez.com&#34;&gt;ergodox-ez&lt;/a&gt; (and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck&#34;&gt;planck
ez&lt;/a&gt;, but I wanted a split board). The
ergodox-ez is a pre-built version of the well-known (to keyboard nerds&amp;hellip;),
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Ergodox-io&#34;&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt;, ortholinear, split keyboard, the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://deskthority.net/wiki/ErgoDox&#34;&gt;ergodox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the Moonlander&amp;rsquo;s features and design, but I ultimately
decided to go with the ergodox-ez for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Moonlander is brand-new and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much feedback for it
yet, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LALQsqZP1nA&#34;&gt;whereas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GPHiJMS7eo&#34;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/comfortable-ergo-keyboard/&#34;&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/03/03/why-this-300-ergonomic-keyboard-might-actually-be-worth-the-money/&#34;&gt;plenty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rtings.com/keyboard/reviews/ergodox/ez&#34;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mmorpg.com/hardware-reviews/ergodox-ez-this-is-what-powerful-looks-like-2000107228&#34;&gt;information&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://matteeyah.com/ergodox-ez-keyboard&#34;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; the ergodox-ez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, because the ergodox has been a popular design for years
now, 3rd-party parts like specialized keycaps sets
can easily be found on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mass.com/&#34;&gt;mass.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mechsupply.co.uk&#34;&gt;other
websites&lt;/a&gt;. This makes the ergodox a bit easier
to customize than the moonlander, at least currently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ergodox is great starting board for testing out the
orthlinear+split design. If there were parts of it I really hated over the
next few years, I could always switch to a moonlander or another split board that better fits my needs,
based on what I learn from the ergodox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if I instead &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the ergodox design and want &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; in a few
years for some reason, I still have the option to &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; one.. and &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt;
scratch that itch XD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a win-win situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered the Ergodox-ez and have had it for a over a month now. If you are
wondering what configuration I selected, and what I think about it so far&amp;hellip;
stay tuned for my next post ;) .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rx-580 Upgrade</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/rx580-upgrade/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/rx580-upgrade/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I noticed that my desktop seemingly did not connect to my
monitor. I used the computer mostly as a server, remoting in via &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;, and
didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of it.  I assumed it was either a mis-plugged cable or a
configuration issue. A few months later, I started to game a bit more and
wanted to use my desktop as a gaming machine again. That is when I realized&amp;hellip;
it was an &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; issue. Long story short, my desktop now has an rx580 instead
of it&amp;rsquo;s old rx560.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-old-card-the-rx560&#34;&gt;My Old Card - The rx560&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the issues, lets recap. Why did I select the rx560 in the
first place? What did I like about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;i-wanted-an-amd-gpu&#34;&gt;I wanted an AMD GPU&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/rx580-upgrade/amd_radeon_logo.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;rx580 price history&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/rx580-upgrade/amd_radeon_logo.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/charmeleon-desktop-design/&#34;&gt;designed and built my desktop&lt;/a&gt;, I
knew I wanted to get an AMD GPU because their open source drivers were great,
and would allow me to skip all the headaches I&amp;rsquo;ve had over the years messing
around with the proprietary Nvidia drivers. I remain &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; pleased with that
decision, and have had zero issues getting games up and running. No hassle,
period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;i-needed-a-card-to-handle-modest-gaming&#34;&gt;I needed a card to handle &lt;em&gt;modest&lt;/em&gt; gaming&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the post about my desktop, I stated that while I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big pc gamer, I
did enjoy the &lt;em&gt;occasional&lt;/em&gt; game. I play many games on consoles, especially the
ones I play with my wife, but desktop gaming is still my favorite. That said, I
don&amp;rsquo;t need all my graphics settings tuned to ultra, and I tend to not play the
&lt;em&gt;newest&lt;/em&gt; games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rx560 was a perfect little card that give me &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; performance to play
most games, without costing too much. GPUs were still coming down from steep
prices due to crypto mining at the time, and saving some money on the GPU
allowed me to buy more RAM (which I needed more), while remaining under budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;i-planned-to-eventually-upgrade&#34;&gt;I planned to eventually upgrade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/rx580-upgrade/side-by-side-photo.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;The rx560 and 580 side-by-side&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/rx580-upgrade/side-by-side-photo.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The rx560 (bottom) next to my new rx580 (top)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I wanted to build a desktop computer again was for the
ability to upgrade it down the road. The build I designed had enough power
to fit all of my needs, but I configured it so that if any part lacked enough
performance over time, I could easily upgrade it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew one of the components I might eventually want to upgrade would be the
GPU. I figured that the rx560 should last me awhile, but if I started playing
more games, I could easily get a better one, and hopefully prices would be
lower. I could always upgrade to an rx580, or an even newer card if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;issues&#34;&gt;Issues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;debugging&#34;&gt;Debugging&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, back to the problem. As I said before, my desktop wouldn&amp;rsquo;t connect to my
monitor. When I &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;&amp;lsquo;ed into it, everything worked as normal, and all of my
VMs and containers spun up without issue, as if there was nothing wrong.  I ran
commands like &lt;code&gt;lspci | grep &#39;VGA&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;neofetch&lt;/code&gt;, and they still correctly
detected and listed the rx560, confirming the system &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; the card was there.
I did some more testing and confirmed that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a signal on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt;
monitor in the house, using a large assortment of cables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/rx580-upgrade/no_display.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Displays would not connect&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/rx580-upgrade/no_display.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;No display would &amp;lsquo;connect&amp;rsquo;, even when plugged in&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attempted to boot into live cds and other os installs, but the system
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even display the BIOS when starting.  Investigating further, I saw in
the logs that the &lt;code&gt;$DISPLAY&lt;/code&gt; was trying to connect via all the various inputs
(DVI, HDMI, etc) during bootup, but would eventually fail stating that there
was &lt;code&gt;No Display Attached&lt;/code&gt;, even when it was plugged in. I opened up the case,
ensured everything was connected properly, and even tried different cables.
Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-possible-solution&#34;&gt;The Possible &amp;lsquo;Solution&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually narrowed down that the problem was being caused by issues with the
GPU, despite it showing up fine in my pci devices. If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the GPU, it was
likely the motherboard&amp;hellip;. So I figured the next best (and easier) step was to
swap in another card and see if it worked. Not having a spare graphics card on
hand, and not being able to borrow one due to COVID-19 lockdown, my only option
was to order one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing the display issues on my workstation was not an &lt;em&gt;urgent&lt;/em&gt; issue.
However, without the ability to connect to a display I couldn&amp;rsquo;t easily
re-install or debug my system if something went wrong. This was compounded by
the fact that I was running &lt;a href=&#34;https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org&#34;&gt;Fedora
Silverblue&lt;/a&gt;, and needed to reboot every
time I wanted to update my packages, never quite sure if I would be able to
&lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; back in when it was done. Lastly, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what availability or
shipping times would be, given the pandemic. So, I decided it was best to just
order a new card now, rather than wait until the problem &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; become urgent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-new-card-the-rx-580&#34;&gt;My New Card: The RX-580&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/rx580-upgrade/rx580_box.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;The rx560 box arrived a few days later&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/rx580-upgrade/rx580_box.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The rx580 box arrived a few days after ordering&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some brief researching, I decided on the rx580. I also considered the 570
and 590, as well as glanced at some of the newer AMD cards. The truth is, my
rx560 worked fine for what I needed. &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; I was getting a new card
though, a small spec bump would be nice. The 580 seemed to provide more than
enough performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, my experience confirms this. I am able to play my games (mostly
Divinity Original Sin II, Minecraft, and City Skylines, right now) generally
above 60 fps, and at mostly high or better settings. Additionally, because the
card isn&amp;rsquo;t being &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; taxed during gameplay, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be heating up
too badly&amp;hellip;  which I also appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/rx580-upgrade/rx580-price-history.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;rx580 price history&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/rx580-upgrade/rx580-price-history.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;rx580 price history&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the card dropped in price since I built my desktop. I purchased the
rx580 for only a little bit more than I originally paid for the rx560, and over
$100 cheaper than what it cost when I built the desktop. For what I need, the
price and performance are perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I&amp;rsquo;m loving it. The rx580 does everything that I need it to and honestly
doesn&amp;rsquo;t give me any problems. Once again, I was able to plug in the card, boot
up the computer, open Steam, and start playing my games. No additional drivers,
no weird configuration, no bloatware. All on Linux. I am &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; happy with the
purchase, and it has once again reminded me why I truly do love having a
desktop/workstation under my desk, even if it is used as a server &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the
time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Authorizing Thunderbolt 3 on Fedora Plasma</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/fedora-kde-tb3/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/fedora-kde-tb3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After buying a &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/&#34;&gt;16&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; the other month,
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a Thunderbolt 3 hub to connect it to my periphery devices.
Luckily, in addition to the macbook, I am able to use the hub with my my work
laptop when working from home. Normally, it works fine. However, last week I
reformatted the work laptop with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://spins.fedoraproject.org/kde/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/em&gt; spin&lt;/a&gt; of
Fedora Workstation 31&amp;hellip; and my TB3 hub stopped playing nicely with it.
Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-issue&#34;&gt;The Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to a NVIDIA Quadro M1000M in my lenovo P50 work laptop, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using
Gnome with Wayland, because that combination seems to have the least amount of
annoying trade-offs. While doing a system refresh, I figured I would see if
things are any different with a clean Fedora 31 Plasma install (they weren&amp;rsquo;t,
but that&amp;rsquo;s beyond this post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/fedora-kde-tb3/gnome-tb3-settings.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Gnome Thunderbolt Settings&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/fedora-kde-tb3/gnome-tb3-settings.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Gnome desktop environment now has a thunderbolt pane
in the settings GUI&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Booting into the live cd, and later the installed system, I noticed that my
Thunderbolt 3 hub did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work while I was in Plasma. That was fine. I
expected it really, because for security reasons Linux distros tend to disable
thunderbolt ports by default.  In gnome, there are now settings to authorize
it (which I guess I had done on my previous install, and forgot about).  In
Plasma however, I needed to install and configure &lt;code&gt;bolt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bolt&#34;&gt;Bolt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/fedora-kde-tb3/bolt-install.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Installing bolt with dnf&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/fedora-kde-tb3/bolt-install.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bolt&lt;/code&gt; is in the Fedora repos and is easily installed with
&lt;code&gt;dnf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fedora, &lt;code&gt;bolt&lt;/code&gt; is in the repos (at least in Fedora 31+), so installing it is
easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo dnf install bolt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once &lt;code&gt;bolt&lt;/code&gt; is installed, it isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad idea to check to make sure it is
running: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl bolt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/fedora-kde-tb3/bolt-systemctl-status.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;bolt systemctl status&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/fedora-kde-tb3/bolt-systemctl-status.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Checking &lt;code&gt;bolt&lt;/code&gt; is running using &lt;code&gt;systemctl status&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the status shows that it isn&amp;rsquo;t running for some reason, it can be started
using &lt;code&gt;systemctl start bolt&lt;/code&gt;. Check the status again, and if it it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; is not
running&amp;hellip; sorry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/fedora-kde-tb3/boltctl.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;boltctl&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/fedora-kde-tb3/boltctl.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With bolt installed, the command &lt;code&gt;boltctl&lt;/code&gt; is available to use. The base command will
show information about attached thunderbolt devices. To see more &lt;code&gt;boltctl&lt;/code&gt;
commands, run &lt;code&gt;boltctl --help&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;authorizing&#34;&gt;Authorizing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/fedora-kde-tb3/boltctl-authorize.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;boltctl authorize&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/fedora-kde-tb3/boltctl-authorize.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Authorizing the device&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; the thunderbolt 3 device, it needs to be authorized. To
authorize a device, first use a plain &lt;code&gt;boltctl&lt;/code&gt; command to get the &lt;code&gt;uuid&lt;/code&gt; of
the device. Next, call &lt;code&gt;boltctl authorize&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;uuid&lt;/code&gt; to authorize it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;boltctl authorize &amp;lt;UUID HERE&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device should now be authorized. When I authorized mine, some of my devices
started showing up automatically, while others needed to be disconnected and
replugged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;enrolling&#34;&gt;Enrolling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/fedora-kde-tb3/bresetoltctl-enroll.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;boltctl enroll&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/fedora-kde-tb3/boltctl-enroll.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Enrolling the device for permanent use&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorizing a device enables it to be used, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee persistence.
While this may be desired to grant &lt;em&gt;temporary&lt;/em&gt; authorization to a device, many
users tend want their device to &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; work, without having to manually
authorize it. In this case, the device should be &lt;em&gt;enrolled&lt;/em&gt; (like &lt;code&gt;systemctl enable&lt;/code&gt;).
Simply call &lt;code&gt;boltctl enroll&lt;/code&gt;, with the device UUID:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;boltctl enroll &amp;lt;UUID HERE&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once enrolled, the device&amp;rsquo;s UUID will be recorded and added to a database. By
default, the device will now automatically be authorized whenever it is
connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it. While the solution isn&amp;rsquo;t very difficult, it can be frustrating to
figure out when it appears that the thunderbolt device simply is not working.
Regardless, I&amp;rsquo;m glad that I now know about &lt;code&gt;bolt&lt;/code&gt; and how to use it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My New 16-inch Macbook Pro: Initial Thoughts</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/macos-challenge/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I &lt;em&gt;mentioned&lt;/em&gt; that I had
purchased a new 2019 16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro by the end of my macOS challenge.  I have
had the laptop for over a month now, but I made sure to take notes on some of
my initial thoughts during the first few days. Here are those thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;selection&#34;&gt;Selection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, &lt;em&gt;a word from our sponsor!&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; Just kidding. However, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to
take a minute to talk about how I selected &lt;em&gt;my first&lt;/em&gt; macbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-desk-website.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;MBP on my desk&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-desk-website.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;New 16&amp;rdquo; MBP on my desk&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While completing the macOS challenge, I decided I wanted to buy a
macbook for personal use. However, I wanted to hold out and wait to hear if the
rumors of a new scissor-switch macbook pro were true, or if I
should be considering a used 2015 Macbook Pro on eBay. Fortunately, the rumor
turned to fact, and Apple released the new 16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro. This news coupled
with a $300-off, Thanksgiving (US) sale, meant that I had a new macbook
shipping to me the first week of December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-base-model-specs&#34;&gt;The Base Model Specs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-closed.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Macbook Pro closed on the table&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-closed.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro closed on the table&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose the base-spec MBP (the cheapest one) for several reasons. First, it
saved me a bunch of money because 1) Apple upgrades tend to be expensive, and 2)
the base models can be found on sale more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the &amp;ldquo;low-end&amp;rdquo; base model specs of the 16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro were
increased to include 16 GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. This meant that it already
had everything I would normally &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to upgrade. So, the specs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- 2.6 GHz (4.5 GHz Turbo Boost) 6-Core (12 thread) i7 CPU
- 16 GB 2666MHz DDR4 RAM
- 512 GB SS
- 16&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Retina&amp;#34; display w/ True Tone
- New Keyboard design, with touchbar and Touch ID
- Four Thunderbold 3 ports
- Headphone Jack
- New speakers and mic
- Silver&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have wanted 32 GB of RAM. But if I think
about it, I &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; need RAM to run clusters of VMs&amp;hellip; which I do on Linux
workstation/servers&amp;hellip; not my laptop. So 16GB should be plenty for the needs of
&lt;em&gt;this machine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-thoughts&#34;&gt;Initial Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, now lets get to my initial thoughts. Remember, these are the
(reformatted) notes I took within about a day or so of receiving the Macbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-keyboard.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Macbook Pro from above&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-keyboard.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;I love both the new keyboard and speakers on the 16&amp;rdquo;
Macbook Pro&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keyboard&lt;/strong&gt; - Well, I’m surprised. I think I actually &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like it. The
first few minutes were a little weird, because I was used to the (2014) MacBook
Air (Also, I had been using &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-hhkb-pro2/&#34;&gt;my
HHKB&lt;/a&gt; all day). After using
it for about an hour now, I think it feels close to the air (which I like),
with &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; travel. It definitely does not have as much travel as my
Thinkpads, but it is acceptable. The keys feel like they “pop” as I type on
them, with a very satisfying bump. Overall, I very much enjoy the typing
experience. As long as it proves to be sturdy and reliable, I’d say this is
a great laptop keyboard. I am very happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trackpad&lt;/strong&gt; - Little weird at first (I had trouble sliding my fingers across
it.  I guess I needed time to oil it a bit lol), but now it seems to be working
well. It is massive, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to register accidental touches much.
Really, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much to say. It does what I need it to, basically &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the
time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen&lt;/strong&gt; - Wonderful. It’s big, bright and the colors look great. Using
the default scaling still, but actually think it’s big enough. It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful
screen large enough to get work done, on a still small-ish laptop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touch Bar&lt;/strong&gt; - Meh. It&amp;rsquo;s whatever. I have already installed better touch tool
😂. I’ll play with that later to figure out how I can switch the
audio/brightness to buttons instead of slides (the main thing I don’t like so
far), and maybe add weather. In summary, with better touch tool, I don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;mind&lt;/em&gt;
having the touch bar, but probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t miss it much if it was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt; - Amazing. Simple as that. They aren&amp;rsquo;t going to replace a
high-end pair of studio monitors, but are probably the best laptop speakers out
there, and likely better than most cheap desktop ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ports&lt;/strong&gt; - Just charging so far. I like being able to charge on
both sides. Side note: the power brick feels like an &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; brick. It is
solid and heavy, which is fine, but did surprise me a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt; - As far as I can tell, great. It seems like it can handle
most of the work loads &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; will need it for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;issues-annoyances-concerns&#34;&gt;Issues/Annoyances/Concerns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-side.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Macbook Pro from side&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-2019-16inch-mbp/mbp-side.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;As for ports, the 16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro has two USB C/Thunderbolt3 ports and a headphone jack on one side (pictured), and 2 more USB C/Thunderbolt3 ports on the other side.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heat&lt;/strong&gt; - As I’m typing this, I do notice the metal at the top of the laptop
(above the Touch Bar) is getting quite toasty. In fact, the keys on the number
row are even a bit warm. I understand that this is where the heat is exhausted,
and that the cooling system probably relies on the aluminum body a bit as a
heat sink. I just hope it’s normal. I should note that this heat up happened
while I was installing Xcode&amp;hellip; which seems to be a beast. Once Xcode finished
installing, it did cool down fast. The entire time, the palm rest remained nice
and cool to the touch. Also, the fans never kicked up for this. So it seems
that the cooling system is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good on this laptop. I just wish it would
kick in a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bit sooner to prevent it from heating up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ports/Adaptor Annoyances&lt;/strong&gt; - Everyone is complaining that there still isn&amp;rsquo;t
an SD card reader, but honestly I could care less. I generally think having
powerful TB3 ports is a good plan, as it allows the user to craft their system
to have whatever ports &lt;em&gt;they need&lt;/em&gt;. For example, I &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; usually need an SD
card reader, but I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use USB3 and HDMI daily. With a dongle/adaptor, I can
have that, and the TB3 connector has enough bandwidth to support it. However, the
annoying part is buying into the TB3 life. I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to buy an expensive
dongle for my new expensive laptop in order to use &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; with it. Also,
the functionality of the adaptors seems to be hit or miss. I got one that
works okay, but only after having to return the first one I bought because it
just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t connect my devices. Very Annoying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrists Rest&lt;/strong&gt; - While I really enjoy the solid feel of the aluminum my
hands rest on (and how it tends to stay cool even when the computer is heating
up), the sharp edge of the laptop cuts into my wrist over time. I will admit
that this is something I have experience on other laptops too. Maybe I just
type wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The 16&amp;rdquo; Macbook Pro is a great all in one portable
workstation&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I love this laptop. It is powerful enough to do everything I
need, and I think Apple has done a great job addressing the complaints users
have had with Macbooks over the last few years. Considering the speaker,
microphone, keyboard, and screen upgrades this is an amazing portable
workstation. As much as I love having a full desk setup, the &amp;ldquo;built-in
periphery devices&amp;rdquo; on this laptop are &lt;em&gt;so good&lt;/em&gt;, I really don&amp;rsquo;t mind working
straight from the laptop. Which coming from &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, is saying something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Challenge - 30 Days with macOS</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/macos-challenge/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/macos-challenge/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have used many operating systems on my computers over the years, including
decades worth of Windows versions, tons of Linux distros, several BSDs, iOS,
Android, and even chromeOS. While I am familiar with using macOS
(I often used the school Macs in college, and my wife had a Macbook Air
throughout medical school), it is the one OS I have never tried as my &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt;
daily driver. After switching to an iPhone and &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/getting-an-ipad/&#34;&gt;getting an
iPad&lt;/a&gt; this year&amp;hellip; I
decided to give macOS a spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Fun fact: I first learned about Linux while attempting to Hackintosh my
laptop in high school.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a mac as the interface device during my personal computing, for 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, &amp;ldquo;interface computer&amp;rdquo; means the device that I sit at and interact with.
For example, I might be sitting at macOS and using it for my web browsing and
music, but working on a project on my linux workstation via a mosh/tmux session
in iTerm. I can use remote Linux computers as much as I please, but should
connect to them through macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that I still used Desktop Linux as my &amp;ldquo;interfacing
computer&amp;rdquo; for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind iOS and macOS teaming up to make my &amp;ldquo;normal person&amp;rdquo;
computing (web browsing, video chatting, emails, and online courses)
easier. I still deeply care about working with Linux at home, but exclusively
on the backend. So having the front end get out of the way, and not tempt me
with the ability to fine-tune it, is a good thing (&lt;em&gt;for me&lt;/em&gt;, currently).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(While I&amp;rsquo;ve slowed down &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=distrohopper&#34;&gt;distro
hopping&lt;/a&gt; the last
few years,&amp;hellip; I have still been swapping my desktop environment every other
month).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I am really only interested in using macOS for my personal
computing.  At work, I don&amp;rsquo;t need my computer to be in step with my personal
phone and/or ipad. In fact, I like having that barrier there. Also, Linux works
REALLY well for the work I do, especially when it comes to running VMs (I love
&lt;code&gt;libvirt&lt;/code&gt;). So, there currently isn&amp;rsquo;t a reason (or even a desire) to switch
there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side Note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I actually wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even consider this challenge if I didn&amp;rsquo;t
get to use Linux so much at work every day, or if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have my Linux
desktop/workstation at home. I already ssh into my desktop to work
from my other devices. In fact, I technically remote into my desktop even when
I&amp;rsquo;m working &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; it, since I do everything in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://podman.io&#34;&gt;container&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;observations&#34;&gt;Observations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a few weeks in macOS, lets break down some observations I
had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;stuff-i-didn-t-like&#34;&gt;Stuff I didn&amp;rsquo;t like&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The elephant in the room… it&amp;rsquo;s very proprietary. I still love open source and
using something that&amp;rsquo;s as locked down and secretive as macOS (and Apple
products in general) feels, well&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;dirty&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/joplin-error.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;joplin error&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/joplin-error.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Error while trying to run Joplin&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had trouble getting some applications like &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/switched-to-joplin-notes/&#34;&gt;Joplin&lt;/a&gt; to work. I later learned that it was likely due to issues with signing the applications in Catalina (I think). Apparently, there is a work-around for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There surprisingly isn’t a great solution for &lt;a href=&#34;https://virt-manager.org&#34;&gt;virt-manager&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to install it using homebrew, but have to launch it from the terminal. I guess I might be able to setup an application launcher for it? I&amp;rsquo;m just surprised there isn&amp;rsquo;t a better solution on mac, or at least one that&amp;rsquo;s easy to find&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that note, it is &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;a href=&#34;https://brew.sh&#34;&gt;brew&lt;/a&gt; exists, but it confuses the hell out of me (What&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;code&gt;cask&lt;/code&gt;? Is it like a &lt;a href=&#34;https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#group-command-label&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dnf group&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; install?). This is most likely because I am new to it, but in my opinion, I still think it is nowhere near as nice as default Linux package managers. This is one area where using Linux for so long has definitely spoiled me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with filesystems is a pain, especially when connecting to network devices. I couldn’t use Finder to do an easy network connection without first setting up samba or nfs on my Linux computers. While I ideally want to setup a proper samba/nfs server on my desktop/server in the long run anyway, it was annoying that it couldn’t just mount the system in the file browser, using something like &lt;code&gt;sftp&lt;/code&gt; under the hood like Linux does..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;video style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; controls&gt;
&lt;source src=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/network-connect.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Connecting to a remote server&amp;rsquo;s filesystem from the
file browser in Gnome (Linux)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Window management isn’t great out of the box. I had to buy &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12&#34;&gt;magnet&lt;/a&gt; to snap/tile my windows. (Alternatively for touch-bar mac users, note that &lt;a href=&#34;https://folivora.ai&#34;&gt;better touch tool&lt;/a&gt; has window snapping and other features built in). Also, I can’t seem to hold a key and click a window anywhere to resize/move like I can in most linux DEs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My desktop workspaces keep changing their order on me (ಠ_ಠ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deviating from the stock experience can become painful.  Don&amp;rsquo;t like using a global menubar, and a dock for applications?&amp;hellip; sorry?
I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are third-party ways to get around it, but they are likely
hacky and not guaranteed to always work across new versions of macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;stuff-i-liked&#34;&gt;Stuff I liked&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I  am actually starting to like the CMD-centric shortcuts. They work everywhere and are nice when working in a terminal (which I do all the time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default keybindings, while different from what I’m used to are intuitive, and consistent across the system. There are not many that are crazy. For example, on Windows/Linux systems, the keybinding to close a window usually defaults to &lt;code&gt;Alt+F4&lt;/code&gt;, so I normally change it to &lt;code&gt;Super+Shift+Q&lt;/code&gt;. While not the exact same as what I do, the macOS default of &lt;code&gt;CMD+Q&lt;/code&gt; is close enough that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to easily adapt to it, without feeling the need to figure out how to change it. It&amp;rsquo;s a similar story across most of the default keybindings. They aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly how I&amp;rsquo;ve been setting mine up, but close enough that I&amp;rsquo;m fine with accepting them as is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iCloud syncing has been nice. Specifically for photos, TODOs, and notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/phonecall.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Receiving and answering a phonecall in macOS&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/phonecall.png&#34; style=&#34;float: right; max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like being able to answer &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; phone calls from my computer.
I hate talking on the phone. Oddly
enough, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind voice chat on the computer, so this works out really
well for me. Synced iMessage and Facetime are also nice, but universal
&lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; phone calls is what I particularly enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profiles. Specifically, setting up something like my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastmail.com&#34;&gt;Fastmail&lt;/a&gt; account in the mail app
was SUPER easy because of this. I basically just downloaded the profile
from fastmail and opened it with mail, and everytihng was setup. That&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find the UI to be really space respecting. In addition to a global menu, title bars on windows are thin and minimal. Combined with scaled font sizes, a lot less space is wasted, especially compared to Gnome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/header-bar-comparison-stacked.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;macOS header bars compared to Gnome&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/macos-challenge/header-bar-comparison-stacked.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;I find macOS to be much more space efficient than Gnome&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos just work without configuring anything/switching back and forth between Wayland and X sessions. I have faith that wayland will mature to this point eventually, but its nice to already have it in macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gestures are fluid and intuitive. Even on the old MacBook air, the trackpad
is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Settings like screentime work across all my “front-end devices”. If I set a downtime for 8:30pm, it boots me off all my devices&amp;hellip; and I get to bed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;macOS comes with a set of well-made core apps (calendar, mail, notes, music,
photos, keynote, garage band, etc). They work for everything I need. If I
want something more advanced, I generally have the full selection of open source and
proprietary apps at my disposal. For example, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Gimp just
fine on the macbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security does actually seem to be a focus on the system. For example, someone
tried to log into my icloud account from a random location the other week.
In under a minute, from my phone, I was able to unlink my account from all
my devices and change the password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;future-plans&#34;&gt;Future Plans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;rsquo;d say this challenge was a success. In fact, it was so successfull,
that I&amp;rsquo;m actually writing up this post on a new &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/&#34;&gt;base model 16&amp;rdquo; MacBook
Pro&lt;/a&gt; (but more on &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; at another time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[ Well, I&amp;rsquo;m really writing it on my desktop, but from the macbook pro ;) ]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan is to use macOS and my iOS
devices to handle my interactive/client computing. I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed having my
apple devices take care of all my &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; person computer needs over the last
few weeks. It has allowed me to finish up required, but mundane tasks easily
and efficiently, so I can better focus when diving into iTerm to work on
complicated Linux server projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I do have some reservations about this plan (mostly that my desktop Linux
skills will fade, and that I&amp;rsquo;ll loose respect in the Linux community), I don&amp;rsquo;t
think it should be too much of an issue. At the end of the day, it is most
important that I am able to spend my limited time learning and building in the
areas I want to focus on, which is back-end, rather than front-end Linux. I
want to love all technology, and be able to help people find the best solution
to their problems, no matter what they use. Maybe one day the OS flame wars
will die down and we can all just get along and build cool shit together.. Till
then, wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Experience with the Large Display Paradox</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/large-display-paradox/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/large-display-paradox/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, I &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-lgud4379b/&#34;&gt;switched to the LG ud4379b&lt;/a&gt;, a 42.5&amp;rdquo;
4k IPS monitor. My initial motivation for &lt;em&gt;upgrading&lt;/em&gt; was to convert to an IPS
panel. However, my &lt;em&gt;selection of monitor&lt;/em&gt; was an attempt to simplify my
hardware, by pairing down my dual 1080p setup. While I wanted a single monitor,
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to drop my total resolution because &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pcmag.com/feature/336710/13-eye-popping-home-office-setups/10&#34;&gt;everyone
knows&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.techradar.com/news/5-reasons-you-need-dual-monitors-in-2017&#34;&gt;that multiple
monitors&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lifewire.com/boost-productivity-with-a-second-monitor-2377817&#34;&gt;are
required&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.business.com/articles/increasing-productivity-how-dual-monitors-can-save-you-time-and-money/&#34;&gt;to get any real
work&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howtogeek.com/174452/beginner-geek-how-to-use-multiple-monitors-to-be-more-productive/&#34;&gt;done,&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/322640&#34;&gt;especially programming&lt;/a&gt;.
Although, after a year of using my massive display, I started to tire from the
&lt;em&gt;large display paradox&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I dive into what exactly the &lt;em&gt;large display paradox&lt;/em&gt; is, lets quickly
refresh on what I have said in the past. In my &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-lgud4379b/&#34;&gt;post about choosing the 43&amp;rdquo;
monitor&lt;/a&gt;, I went into depth about my history of using dual
monitors, and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I wanted to switch to a single monitor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I like having the screen real estate of two monitors, I was never able to optimally use them because of the bezels between the monitors. While working, I would naturally shift over and use one monitor as a primary display, and the other as a secondary display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be able to view my monitor straight on, without any
bezels getting in the way. I also knew that a single 1080p monitor was just a
bit too cramped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that same paragraph, I provided an additional reason for the switch. If I
had been paying closer attention, I might have noticed it
foreshadowing issues I would face with a large display:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was okay for some tasks, but it usually meant that I just used the primary monitor, and half of the secondary one, &lt;strong&gt;because it was too hard to see the far end of the screen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/large-display-paradox/4-monitors.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Wayland logo&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/large-display-paradox/4-monitors.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;I was excited to use a single monitor as a 4x 21&amp;rdquo; 1080p bezel-less
grid.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was aware that a large screen may not be optimal, but the alure of having
four monitors in one was too strong. This is emphasized in the section where I
compare the LG 43&amp;rdquo; with a Dell ultrawide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being so large, I could still have auxiliary windows opened on either side. One advantage the ud4379 had over the ultra-wide however, was that being a massive 16:9 screen, it could easily be divided into 4 1080p screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the nagging voice in the back of my head saying the ultrawide might be
more &lt;em&gt;reasonable&lt;/em&gt;, or reminding me that a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; 27&amp;rdquo; 1440p monitor was also an
option&amp;hellip; I ignored it and picked up the 43&amp;rdquo; LG (which nonetheless, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a great
monitor!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-large-display-paradox&#34;&gt;The Large Display Paradox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then. What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Large Display Paradox&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;? As far as I can find, the
term was coined by Jeff Atwood in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-large-display-paradox/&#34;&gt;blog
post&lt;/a&gt; titled with the
same name. In the post, Atwood refers to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dansdata.com/3007wfp-hc.htm&#34;&gt;another
post&lt;/a&gt; in which Dan Rutter states the
following while reviewing his new Dell UltraSharp 3007WFP-HC monitor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of 30-inch monitors face the terrible, terrible problem of how to
effectively use all of that space. You don&amp;rsquo;t often want to maximise a folder or
document window on a screen this big; either you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with a lot of white
space and important program buttons separated by a vast expanse of nothing, or
you&amp;rsquo;ll get lines of text 300 or more characters long, which are difficult to
read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atwood summarizes that this is a perfect example of what he deems to be the
&lt;em&gt;Large Display Paradox&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the large display paradox. Having all that space can make you less
productive due to all the window manipulation excise you have to deal with to
make effective use of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He further explains how once a display grows beyond the point of being able to
efficiently maximize windows without too much whitespace (above 1600x1200, by
his estimates), it becomes &lt;em&gt;less productive&lt;/em&gt; due to the user having to
continuously manage the windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these posts are on the older side (2007!), I think most people are more
likely to experience this issue &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;, due to cheaper large monitor options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-experience&#34;&gt;My Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;em&gt;Large Display Paradox&lt;/em&gt; finally defined&amp;hellip; did I experience it using
my 43&amp;rdquo; monitor? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, it was great. I loved throwing everything I wanted up on a single
screen, without any applications overlapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, during the first few months using the monitor, I still worked
remotely at my previous job and needed to use a Windows machine. I appreciated
that I could RDP to my work computer using an ultrawide resolution (3440x1440),
but &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have extra pixels to keep my notes and chat windows below it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/large-display-paradox/work-widescreen.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Widescreen work RDP session&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/large-display-paradox/work-widescreen.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Remoting into my Windows work computer using an ultrawide
resolution, and still having space for my notes and chat applications below.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I switched jobs and used Linux 100% for home &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; work. Instead of
having to RDP into a second machine&amp;hellip; I could just &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; using a small
terminal window. I no longer &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to view multiple machine desktops to get work
done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;issues&#34;&gt;Issues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice any issues, especially when using it on my personal
computer which I mostly used for leisure anyway. It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter much if I had
a video and chat window next to a personal project I was working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, over time I started to notice that when  I tried to actually &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt; on a
task, the &amp;ldquo;usefulness&amp;rdquo; of the large screen really started to fall apart. Below
are a few issues I started to run up against when trying to be productive with
what was seemingly one of &amp;ldquo;the best productivity monitors on the market&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;always-wanting-to-fill-the-space&#34;&gt;Always wanting to fill the space.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tricky thing about having all that space&amp;hellip; is you want to fill it, even if
you don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to for the task at hand. So for example, if I wanted to work
on writing a blog post, all I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; is a text editor. In addition, I like to
have a preview of the post open in a browser so I can see how it renders.  I
sometimes like to also have a photo editor and picture folders open, but I find
it best if I can have them in a separate &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_workplace&#34;&gt;virtual
workspace&lt;/a&gt;. With the large
display, I would open up &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; those windows on the same screen. In reality,
having anything beyond my text editor and post preview in front of me, really
starts to detract from my ability to focus on &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt; the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/large-display-paradox/filling-space.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Filling up the monitor&#39;s space&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/large-display-paradox/filling-space.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;With so much space, I felt obligated to fill it with
windows unrelated to the task at hand.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like filling space. How often do you find that a
surface in the house seems to &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; collect random crap? Large
monitors are the same. Even when I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; I only needed a one small terminal
in from of me&amp;hellip; the vast space surrounding it made me feel uneasy. So, I
would fill the space by either extending the editor window to a comical size,
or litter the surround space with random applications, unrelated to the work I
was trying to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;i-didn-t-use-the-entire-space-just-focused-on-what-was-in-my-field-of-view-in-front-of-me&#34;&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t use the entire space, just focused on what was in my field of view in front of me.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I felt obligated to fill all the space, &lt;em&gt;I still didn&amp;rsquo;t use all of
it&lt;/em&gt;. When I had two monitors, I would center myself on one to prevent looking at
bezels, and then usually only utilize &lt;em&gt;half&lt;/em&gt; of the secondary monitor, because
the far end of it was out of my sight. This didn&amp;rsquo;t change with a single large
monitor. I usually found my self using an &amp;ldquo;appropriately sized&amp;rdquo; window, smack
in the middle of the screen. If I needed to switch to working in a different
application, I would move &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; application to the center and focus on it. The
outer spaces of the monitor were never fully used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;i-couldn-t-fullscreen-or-even-split-screen-my-windows&#34;&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t fullscreen (or even split-screen) my windows&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/large-display-paradox/split-screen.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Using Split Screen Windows&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/large-display-paradox/split-screen.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 5px 15px 10px 10px&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Fullscreen, and even split screen windows were unwieldy.
Most of the time I just wanted to work from a normal sized window.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of focusing on a single application&amp;hellip; fullscreen&amp;hellip; it isn&amp;rsquo;t really
an option on such a big monitor. While a maximized window might look awesome at
first, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very practical for day-to-day use. This issue was compounded
by the &amp;ldquo;shadow&amp;rdquo; that prevented me from seeing the first few characters near the
edge of the screen. The size of the screen combined with how far I sat from it,
meant that all but the center was out of my field of view. As such, I didn&amp;rsquo;t
maximize my windows, and usually just wanted a normal-sized one in the center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;bad-keyboard-window-management-experience&#34;&gt;Bad Keyboard Window Management Experience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without being able to view windows in full or split screen configurations, all
of the quick window-snapping key bindings I&amp;rsquo;ve become accustomed to were
useless.  I was forced to switch over to my mouse more than I would like to.
While &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuIK-NuN3aY&#34;&gt;some might point to using window management
software&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=&#34;https://jonblack.me/large-display-paradox-resolved/&#34;&gt;tiling window
manager&lt;/a&gt;, I don&amp;rsquo;t think
this would solve &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; issues. You &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to get away with using a
window manager like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Airblader/i3&#34;&gt;i3-gaps&lt;/a&gt; (or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/swaywm/sway&#34;&gt;sway&lt;/a&gt;) on a 1440p ultrawide monitor, but a
full unscaled 4k space is just too much. Unless you &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have 5+ tiled
windows open at a time, they&amp;rsquo;re just too big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the large display paradox could be a real modern tech issue. Well, more
accurately, a major &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_problem&#34;&gt;first world
problem&lt;/a&gt;. Given the
increased affordability of large displays, what might &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; like an great setup,
might not actually be optimal for one&amp;rsquo;s workload. At it&amp;rsquo;s core, technology
is a tool. When choosing tech hardware, we should always focus on what
the best tool &lt;em&gt;for the job&lt;/em&gt; is, and not just what is the best tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New LG-32QK500-w Monitor</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/new-lg32qk500w/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/new-lg32qk500w/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of summer, I was entertaining the idea of improving my wife&amp;rsquo;s
computer setup by adding a new external monitor. She agreed. As a result, we
have purchased, recieved, and even &lt;em&gt;mounted&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-32QK500-W-led-monitor&#34;&gt;LG
32QK500w&lt;/a&gt; monitor.
Here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reasoning&#34;&gt;Reasoning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, my wife has had to spend more time prepping at night for her next workday, which
she does on her laptop. This made it a good time to finally setup her
office space in the guest bedroom. She has an old 21.5&amp;rdquo; 1080p monitor from
college, but we decided it might not be the best fit for the
space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/dpi-32.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Netflix logo&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/netflix.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thought that it would be nice to have a larger screen in that room, guests
could watch video content. Additionally, my wife and I have a habit of falling
asleep on the couch watching TV most weekend nights&amp;hellip; but we want to keep our
bedroom TV free. Having a spot where we can lay down on a bed and prep for the
inevitable while watching a movie, is probably a good idea (and our backs agree).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started looking for slightly larger monitors and quickly noticed something&amp;hellip; the
2560x1440 32&amp;rdquo; monitors were cheaper than their 27&amp;rdquo; counterparts. This
made sense, as the dpi is lower. However, after doing the math, 2560x1440 pixels @ 32&amp;rdquo; is
the same dpi of as a 24&amp;rdquo; 1920x1080 monitor (109 dots per inch). While this
isn&amp;rsquo;t the &lt;em&gt;sharpest&lt;/em&gt; configuration, it is very common and reasonable for productivity setups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/dpi-32.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;2560 by 1440 pixels at 32 inches has a dpi of 91.&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/dpi-32.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;2560x1440 pixels at 32&amp;rdquo; has a dpi of 91&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/dpi-24.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;1920 by 1080 pixels at 24 inches also has a dpi of 91.&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/dpi-24.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;1920x1080 pixels at 24&amp;rdquo; also has a dpi of 91&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, my wife doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the best vision (especially at night when she
tends to work), and tends to actually &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; the larger scale of 109 dpi. We
even purposefully picked a 1600x900 resolution screen over a FHD one when
buying her Thinkpad for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, while it is scaled up a bit on a physically larger display, these
monitors still provide a 2560x1440 resolution. Recently, I have decided that
this particular resolution, may be the best for productivity , at least in the
type of workflows I use. I even figured out how to &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/sub-monitor-workflows-with-xrandr/&#34;&gt;configure a 2560x1440
&amp;ldquo;sub-monitor&amp;rdquo; on my 43&amp;rdquo; QHD monitor&lt;/a&gt;
when I need to &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt;. Having an &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; 2560x1440 monitor in the house would
be wonderful for both my wife&amp;rsquo;s and my own productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;selection&#34;&gt;Selection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/box.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;New monitor box&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/box.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The new monitor in it&amp;rsquo;s box&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I wanted a 32&amp;rdquo;, 2560x1440 IPS monitor&amp;hellip; at a decent price. After browsing
around amazon, I came across the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LD6XJ8X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;LG
32QK500W&lt;/a&gt;.
It was listed at a very reasonable price (on sale), had a few bonus features
(75 Hz refresh + freesync options), and was an LG IPS panel, which I felt
comfortable purchasing considering how much I enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-lgud4379b/&#34;&gt;my LG
monitor&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the LG 32QK500-W has the following specs/features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;32 inch, 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IPS Panel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mDP and 2 HDMI imports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VESA mount compatible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decently thin bezels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; 75 Hertz refresh rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freesync&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On sale for less than $250 (USD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also purchased a cheap &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BCUM766/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;Amazon basics
mount&lt;/a&gt;
to wall mount it, but in hindsight it might of been worth paying a little
extra for a better one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-like&#34;&gt;What I Like&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;resolution&#34;&gt;Resolution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/screenshot.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Screenshot of working on monitor&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/screenshot.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The resolution is perfect for productivity work.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;2k&amp;rdquo; resolution is perfect. It gives just enough space to get work done,
but not &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much space that it is distracting. I can perfectly fit two &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt;
windows next to each other on the screen. At the same time, it is still a small
enough resolution that a single focused full screen window doesn&amp;rsquo;t look odd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;colors&#34;&gt;Colors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colors look great. They are vivid, and the blacks are &lt;em&gt;dark&lt;/em&gt;.
I think I may even enjoy them better than on my own monitor&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;75-hz-refresh-rate-and-freesync&#34;&gt;75 Hz refresh rate (and Freesync!)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the 75 Hz refresh rate and Freesync was a nice little bonus. While the
only computer we have in the house that can &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; take advantage of these
features is &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/charmeleon-desktop-design/&#34;&gt;my desktop&lt;/a&gt; (which is in another
room)&amp;hellip;  it&amp;rsquo;s nice to know we have the option if I want to test it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-don-t-like&#34;&gt;What I Don&amp;rsquo;t Like&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;no-speakers-and-audio-jack-is-noisy&#34;&gt;No speakers&amp;hellip; and audio jack is noisy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, I could care less if a monitor has speakers or not. They usually
sound terrible, and I end up plugging external headphones/speakers to the
computer directly anyway. However, as we intend to also use this monitor as a
&amp;ldquo;TV&amp;rdquo; via an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=amazon+fire+stick&amp;amp;qid=1563791000&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;Amazon
Firestick&lt;/a&gt;,
it would be nice to have even &lt;em&gt;basic&lt;/em&gt; speakers to pump audio through by
default. It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have a 3.5mm headphone jack, but there seemed to be a bit of
noise when I tried it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;while-dpi-is-perfect-for-it-s-use-it-isn-t-the-best&#34;&gt;While dpi is perfect for it&amp;rsquo;s use, it isn&amp;rsquo;t the best&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, the dpi isn&amp;rsquo;t the best, and the image isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as
&amp;ldquo;crisp&amp;rdquo; as you might find on a high resolution display. Also, at such a large
screen size, it is almost required to sit back from the screen a little bit
further than normal. However, as I already described in the sections above&amp;hellip;
for our use case, this was actually preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/desk.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Screenshot of working on monitor&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/desk.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The monitor all set up mounted above my wife&amp;rsquo;s new
desk. (Next step&amp;hellip; hide the wires!)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t much left to say. At this price point, and for what we wanted this
monitor for, I think it was a perfect match. While it might not be the absolute
&lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; monitor out there, it is a great value. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a large
1440p monitor to get some work done on, that could also be a TV replacement at
a good price (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you college students), I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating a RAM Disk with a tmpfs Mount</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/tmpfs-mount-ramdisk/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/tmpfs-mount-ramdisk/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;RAM is fun. If a computer has &lt;em&gt;extra&lt;/em&gt; memory, it can be used for fun &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt;
opening extra chrome tabs, or firing up Slack. Want to mount a partition that
is &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; and can be entirely wiped out just by rebooting? Or are you just
bored (guilty)?  Regardless of the reason, lets create and mount a RAM-disk!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ram-disks-and-tmpfs&#34;&gt;RAM disks and tmpfs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a RAM disk in Linux is actually quite easy. Unlike other OS&amp;rsquo;s, it
doesn&amp;rsquo;t require special third-party software or digging deep into the registry.
This is because RAM-based file systems are already heavily used in a Linux system.
Many root sub-directories are actually mounted
&lt;a href=&#34;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/tmpfs.5.html&#34;&gt;tmpfs&lt;/a&gt; objects, most
notably &lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt;. To see some &lt;code&gt;tmpfs&lt;/code&gt; mounts on a system, &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt;
command for &lt;code&gt;tmpfs&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;➜  ~ df -h | grep tmpfs
devtmpfs                  16G     &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;   16G   0% /dev
tmpfs                     16G  299M   16G   2% /dev/shm
tmpfs                     16G  2.0M   16G   1% /run
tmpfs                     16G     &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;   16G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
tmpfs                     16G  5.9M   16G   1% /tmp
tmpfs                    3.2G  184K  3.2G   1% /run/user/1000
tmpfs                     12G     &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;   12G   0% /var/ramdisk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the contents of a &lt;code&gt;tmpfs&lt;/code&gt; filesystem reside in system memory, typically
RAM. This allows file access that is &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;.  However, like RAM,
&lt;code&gt;tmpfs&lt;/code&gt; is also &lt;em&gt;volatile&lt;/em&gt;, meaning it will all be erased if the computer
restarts or shuts down. So don&amp;rsquo;t store anything important in &lt;code&gt;tmpfs&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fstab&#34;&gt;fstab&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to add a new &amp;lsquo;RAM disk&amp;rsquo; to our system is by adding it as a new
mount in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt; file. I&amp;rsquo;m currently running &lt;a href=&#34;https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/&#34;&gt;Fedora
Silverblue&lt;/a&gt;, so I had to place it under
&lt;code&gt;/var/&lt;/code&gt; because I don&amp;rsquo;t have write access elsewhere, but feel free to place
your mount wherever you want. Just &lt;strong&gt;make sure the location exists&lt;/strong&gt;, or the
system won&amp;rsquo;t boot correctly when loading the &lt;code&gt;fstab&lt;/code&gt;. After adding the following line
to &lt;code&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt;, a 10G &lt;code&gt;tmpfs&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lsquo;device&amp;rsquo; will be mounted at &lt;code&gt;/var/ramdisk&lt;/code&gt; during
each boot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# /etc/fstab&lt;/span&gt;
...
tmpfs      /var/ramdisk       tmpfs   rw,nodev,nosuid,size&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;10G	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, Linux allocates half the RAM available on the system to a new
&lt;code&gt;tmpfs&lt;/code&gt; mount. However, I wanted to specify my disk size, so I used the &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;
argument to allocate 10G.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mounting&#34;&gt;Mounting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;code&gt;fstab&lt;/code&gt; edited, it is time to mount everything. &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Tmpfs&#34;&gt;The arch wiki
page&lt;/a&gt; cautions &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; running
&lt;code&gt;mount -a&lt;/code&gt; to mount the new &lt;em&gt;tmpfs&lt;/em&gt; disks, but that is because any files that
might already be in the directories will be removed during the mount. While
this may be a concern when editing any of the already &amp;ldquo;naturally occurring&amp;rdquo; &lt;code&gt;tmpfs&lt;/code&gt;
mounts on a system (such as &lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/run&lt;/code&gt;), our use case is adding a
&lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; one. So, we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be safe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;sudo mount -a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify that the RAM disk is mounted, check the &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; output. (&lt;em&gt;Note: It
should be empty since it was just allocated&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;$ df -h
...
tmpfs                     10G     &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;   10G   0% /var/ramdisk
...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;testing&#34;&gt;Testing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the tmpfs mount, how can we be sure it&amp;rsquo;s actually functioning as a
RAM disk? The simplest way to test it is&amp;hellip; move some files over to the mount
location and see if it starts to use up RAM!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my quick test, I quickly copied two large &lt;code&gt;iso&lt;/code&gt; files to the new mount:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;../../img/posts/tmpfs-mount-ramdisk/ram-disk-usage.gif&#39;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Copied some iso files to ramdisk&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/tmpfs-mount-ramdisk/ram-disk-usage.png&#34; onmouseover=&#34;this.src=&#39;../../img/posts/tmpfs-mount-ramdisk/ram-disk-usage.gif&#39;&#34; onmouseout=&#34;this.src=&#39;../../img/posts/tmpfs-mount-ramdisk/ram-disk-usage.png&#39;&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;When copying files to a tmpfs mount, RAM usages increases
by the amount copied.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;sudo cp -r ./*.iso /var/ramdisk/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the copy, I had the gnome &lt;code&gt;System Monitor&lt;/code&gt; application opened so I could
see if the RAM usage slowly climbed as the files copied&amp;hellip; and it did!
Additionally, when I deleted the copied files, the RAM usage went back down.
Looks like everything worked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While RAM disks are less useful these days due to faster and faster
storage, they can still be fun. I&amp;rsquo;ve placed a full Linux file system in mine,
 &lt;code&gt;chroot&lt;/code&gt;&amp;lsquo;ed into it, and ran a full DE with xorg and everything! It was quite
snappy. I also use it as a &amp;lsquo;scratch&amp;rsquo; disk where I can work on a temporary
project and blow it away when I&amp;rsquo;m done. The options are endless!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating &#34;Sub&#34;-Monitor Workflows Using xrandr</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/sub-monitor-workflows-with-xrandr/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/sub-monitor-workflows-with-xrandr/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago I swapped out my dual monitor setup for a single (but
massive), &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-lgud4379b/&#34;&gt;42.5&amp;rdquo; UHD IPS display&lt;/a&gt;. I love it, but admit
that sometimes, it has &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; workspace. While I still think that the
larger display was better choice, I sometimes wish that
I had the more limited, but &lt;em&gt;focused&lt;/em&gt; workspace of an ultrawide or 1440p
monitor. &lt;em&gt;Maybe I still can&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reasoning&#34;&gt;Reasoning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. I understand that this post might seem ridiculous to most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But Ryan, if you have a great display with such a large resolution, why
would you want to &lt;strong&gt;intentionally&lt;/strong&gt; scale it down smaller?!?!?!&amp;ldquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, there are a number of occasions when having a single, smaller
display is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;focused-work&#34;&gt;Focused Work&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, when trying to focus deeply on a single task, I like to have the windows
that I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; for the activity opened, and nothing else. Furthermore, I like
to have these windows opened at a &lt;em&gt;reasonable size&lt;/em&gt; (Note: a full screen
3840x2160 single terminal looks stupid). With such a big screen, it is just too
tempting to drag chat windows, monitoring apps, and videos to the sides of the workspace.
While 1080p is a little cramped, I think a single 1440p resolution is &lt;a href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/why-i-stopped-using-multiple-monitors-bfd87efa2e5b&#34;&gt;more
ideal for &lt;em&gt;focused
work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
(especially because I tend to take advantage of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_desktop&#34;&gt;virtual
desktops&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;tiling-window-managers&#34;&gt;Tiling Window Managers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/sub-monitor-workflows-with-xrandr/i3-writing.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;writing this post with i3&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/sub-monitor-workflows-with-xrandr/i3-writing.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;I actually wrote most of the draft for this post in i3&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, when working (especially programming), I often like to use tiling
window managers ( &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/started-using-i3blocks/&#34;&gt;i3 for example&lt;/a&gt; ). This lets me
&lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; without having to manually move around the windows, or even leave my
keyboard. In tiling window managers, applications tend to open up full screen by
default, which again&amp;hellip; is just obnoxious on such a large display.
Scaling down the display allows me to still use tiling window managers without
compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;gaming&#34;&gt;Gaming&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a half-reason is gaming. I&amp;rsquo;m not a huge gamer so I didn&amp;rsquo;t opt for a
crazy graphics card when I &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/charmeleon-desktop-design/&#34;&gt;designed and built my
desktop&lt;/a&gt;. When I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;
game, I usually play in windowed-mode (which
is usually a better experience anyway&amp;hellip; again for field of view reasons).
However, sometimes a game won&amp;rsquo;t support windowed mode, or I want to
play full screen at a lower resolution so that my GPU can handle it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how&#34;&gt;How&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that it is (hopefully) understood &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I want to setup a &amp;ldquo;sub-display&amp;rdquo;
inside my monitor, lets switch to &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;problem-1-scaling&#34;&gt;Problem 1: Scaling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get &amp;ldquo;sub&amp;rdquo;-resolutions working, I had to fix two problems. The first was that
even if I select a smaller resolution on my computer, most monitors will
display that resolution, but scaled to the size of the display. For example, if
I set my computer&amp;rsquo;s display settings to 1920x1080 on my 3840x2160 monitor, by
default it will double up the pixels to get the smaller resolution
to &lt;em&gt;fit&lt;/em&gt; full-size on the monitor. This makes everything appear gigantic&amp;hellip; which
is the exact opposite of what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After playing around in my monitor&amp;rsquo;s input settings, I noticed that there is an
&amp;ldquo;Aspect Ratio&amp;rdquo; field, with a &lt;code&gt;1:1&lt;/code&gt; option. When selected, the monitor displays
an image at its pixel density. So a 1920x1080 pixel display shows as a smaller
image in the middle of the screen, but with a &lt;code&gt;1:1&lt;/code&gt; pixel density. Problem #1 solved!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;problem-2-new-resolution-sets&#34;&gt;Problem 2: New Resolution Sets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second problem was that by default, many of the resolutions I wanted to use
out do not show up in the display settings. This makes sense, as &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people
won&amp;rsquo;t be selecting &lt;code&gt;21:9&lt;/code&gt; resolutions on a &lt;code&gt;16:9&lt;/code&gt; panel. I needed to add
new options using &lt;code&gt;xrandr&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending sometime in a terminal with &lt;code&gt;xrandr&lt;/code&gt;, I was able to create new &lt;code&gt;xrandr&lt;/code&gt; modes, and set my monitor to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;creating-a-new-xrandr-mode&#34;&gt;Creating a new xrandr mode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a new xrandr mode, I first needed to calculate a new modeline. This
can be done by using the &lt;code&gt;gtf&lt;/code&gt; tool. To calculate a modeline for a
3440x1440 resolution at 59.9 hertz for example, use the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;➜  ~ gtf &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3440&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1440&lt;/span&gt; 59.9

  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# 3440x1440 @ 59.90 Hz (GTF) hsync: 89.25 kHz; pclk: 418.41 MHz&lt;/span&gt;
  Modeline &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;3440x1440_59.90&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;  418.41  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3440&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3688&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;4064&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;4688&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1440&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1441&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1444&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1490&lt;/span&gt;  -HSync +Vsync

➜  ~&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line that starts with &lt;em&gt;Modeline&lt;/em&gt; (but &lt;em&gt;not including&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;Modeline&amp;rdquo;) is what
we want. Copy that and give it to &lt;code&gt;xrandr&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;--newmode&lt;/code&gt; flag to create
a new mode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;xrandr --newmode &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;3440x1440_59.90&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;  418.41  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3440&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3688&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;4064&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;4688&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1440&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1441&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1444&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1490&lt;/span&gt;  -HSync +Vsync&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, to add that mode to a display, use that same line but with the
&lt;code&gt;--addmode&lt;/code&gt; flag, and the monitor to switch (&lt;code&gt;DP-1&lt;/code&gt; in my case):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;xrandr --addmode DP-1 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;3440x1440_59.90&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;  418.41  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3440&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3688&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;4064&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;4688&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1440&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1441&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1444&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1490&lt;/span&gt;  -HSync +Vsync&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: To find the available monitor names, enter a plain &lt;code&gt;xrandr&lt;/code&gt; command, and
it will spit out all the available outputs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;switching-to-the-new-mode&#34;&gt;Switching to the new mode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;arandr&#34;&gt;arandr&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To switch to the new mode, I like to use a GUI tool named &lt;code&gt;arandr&lt;/code&gt;.  Simply right
click on the display&amp;rsquo;s rectangle, and select the new mode name from the
&amp;ldquo;Resolution&amp;rdquo; list (Or &lt;em&gt;Outputs&lt;/em&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Monitor Name&lt;/em&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Resolution&lt;/em&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;New MODE
NAME&lt;/em&gt; in the menu bar).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/sub-monitor-workflows-with-xrandr/arandr-select-newmode.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Using arandr to select new mode&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/sub-monitor-workflows-with-xrandr/arandr-select-newmode.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;arandr&lt;/code&gt; to select new mode (SO many resolutions XD )&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;xrandr&#34;&gt;xrandr&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are too &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet&#34;&gt;1337&lt;/a&gt; to use a GUI app,
never fear! The display can be switched to the new mode using &lt;code&gt;xrandr&lt;/code&gt; with the
&lt;code&gt;--output&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--mode&lt;/code&gt; flags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;xrandr --output DP-1 --mode &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;3440x1440_59.90&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;  418.41  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3440&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3688&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;4064&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;4688&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1440&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1441&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1444&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1490&lt;/span&gt;  -HSync +Vsync&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-wait-there-s-more-scripting-it&#34;&gt;But Wait, There&amp;rsquo;s More! Scripting it:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After running these commands twice&amp;hellip; I realized it would be easy enough to
automate. So I did with this script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;#!/bin/bash

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# A function to prompt the user if they want to switch to the new mode now.&lt;/span&gt;
switch_to_new_mode &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;add-xrandr.sh&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, the script is run by providing it the desired width, height, and
&lt;code&gt;xrandr&lt;/code&gt; display to apply the new mode to. For example, to create a new
&lt;code&gt;3440x1440&lt;/code&gt; mode for my &lt;code&gt;DP-1&lt;/code&gt; display, I would run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;./add-xrandr.sh &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3440&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1440&lt;/span&gt; DP-1.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script will generate a new mode based on the parameters fed it it, and then
check to see if the mode already exists. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, it will create it, add
it to the display name passed in, and will ask the user if they would like to
switch to the new mode. If the mode &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; already detected, the script will just
ask the user if they wish to switch to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The script is hard-coded to always create modes at &lt;code&gt;59.9&lt;/code&gt; Hertz,
because I don&amp;rsquo;t have any fancy fast monitors. If you want that option, just add
another parameter and swap out the &lt;code&gt;59.9&lt;/code&gt; with it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pros-cons&#34;&gt;Pros/Cons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/sub-monitor-workflows-with-xrandr/ultrawide-mode.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Monitor in &#39;ultrawide mode&#39;&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/sub-monitor-workflows-with-xrandr/ultrawide-mode.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Monitor in &amp;lsquo;ultrawide mode&amp;rsquo;. It is set to 3440x1440px and
measures ~36&amp;rdquo; diagonally.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-this-solves&#34;&gt;What this solves&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I have the monitor set to a sub-resolution, I don&amp;rsquo;t experience any of
the &amp;ldquo;edge shadowing&amp;rdquo; issues I mentioned in the review post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can test out any resolution setup less than 2840x2160. (Including Ultrawide
setups)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a smaller resolution is friendlier to my tiling wm setups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can use a better &amp;ldquo;single focus&amp;rdquo; monitor setup. For example, the equivalent of a 28&amp;rdquo;
1440p display.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can set my monitor to a smaller resolution to better play full screen games (so that
the resolution better fits my GPU performance &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the game is in my
field of view)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-it-doesn-t-fix&#34;&gt;What it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fix&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; size of my monitor stays the same. (MASSIVE Bezels :P )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t really do multiple displays setups. Even though my monitor supports
multiple inputs and picture-by-picture, I still can&amp;rsquo;t do a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; horizontal +
vertical 1080p setup, because it will center each one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DPI is slightly bigger than if I got the &lt;em&gt;common&lt;/em&gt; size/pixel monitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any &lt;em&gt;curving&lt;/em&gt; or other physical attributes another monitor form factor has.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I love this setup. With this work-around, I was able to take a few
use cases where my monitor didn&amp;rsquo;t fully fit my needs, and fix it. I am even
happier with my monitor selection now, as I can enjoy a massive IPS display when I want it,
but also have the ability to tone it down when I want to focus in more. So far,
it&amp;rsquo;s working great!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Switching to a Mesh Network</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/switching-to-mesh-network/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/switching-to-mesh-network/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, I updated our home networking equipment to an Ubiqui
setup. However, we recently moved into a new house and I switched to a
mesh wifi network. No, the switch was not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; to increase wifi
coverage throughout the entire house. The real motivator
(ironically)&amp;hellip; was that I needed a better ethernet connection&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About two years ago, I &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/upgrading-network-to-ubiquiti/&#34;&gt;replaced my Linksys wifi
router(s)&lt;/a&gt;
with the tiny-but-mighty &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.ui.com/products/edgerouter-x&#34;&gt;Ubiquity Edge Router
X&lt;/a&gt;, paired with an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-lite/&#34;&gt;Ubiqui AP AC
lite&lt;/a&gt; wifi access point. I loved
it. It handled our web traffic flawlessly, and unlike the previous Linksys
routers, I never had to randomly restart it. It just worked for months on end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/switching-to-mesh-network/google-fiber-box.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The Google Fiber network box&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/switching-to-mesh-network/google-fiber-box.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Google Fiber &amp;ldquo;network box&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the setup &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much in fact, that while I was thrilled to
have a Google Fiber internet connection when we moved to Durham NC
last year, I was a little sad that setting up the edgerouter on the
fiber modem required a little bit of tweaking. I looked into it
but ultimately decided that figuring it out wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth the hassle
for the short period of time which we&amp;rsquo;d likely live in the
apartment. So, I reluctantly used the Google provided box which worked &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;we-moved&#34;&gt;We Moved&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Google fiber was indeed short lived, as my wife and I just moved
into a house this past month. When working with Spectrum to setup our
internet (&lt;em&gt;yea&amp;hellip; I know&lt;/em&gt;), we discovered that while there were coax
plugs in both the living room and master bedroom, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t
actually find any hook-ups to connect the house to the external cable/internet
service line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;cable-line-in-bedroom&#34;&gt;Cable-line in Bedroom&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After searching with multiple techs, we decided just to have them
drill a line into the master bedroom (which is at the back of the
house and allows the connection box to be with the other utility
meters). Our house isn&amp;rsquo;t massive, and having the router in the bedroom
works well enough, except for &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have several servers and desktop computers that &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; an
ethernet connection, either because they don&amp;rsquo;t have wifi cards, and/or
because I use Wake-On-Lan with them. This means that I need an
ethernet connection in my office&amp;hellip; at the front of the house. Now
that the only ethernet router/switch was in the bedroom, and the rest
of the house relied on wifi&amp;hellip;  I needed to figure something out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;power-line-issues&#34;&gt;Power-line Issues&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In past apartments, I had used power-line ethernet adapters to extend
ethernet from a router in a different room to my computers. The speeds
weren&amp;rsquo;t great, but then again, neither was our connection so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t
a huge problem. This time though, I ran some tests&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/switching-to-mesh-network/internet-speed-comparison.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Diagram comparing internet speeds: 1) Plugged directly into Router: 27 ms ping, 231.44 Mbps Download, 11.79 Mbps upload 2) Wifi in Office: 17 ms ping, 178.74 Mbps Download, 11.72 Mbps Upload 3) Powerline Ethernet in Office: 15 ms ping, 17.66 MBps Download, 11.86 Mbps Upload.&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/switching-to-mesh-network/internet-speed-comparison.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Different internet Speed test results after hooking up
internet to the house.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while it &lt;em&gt;worked&lt;/em&gt;, this setup wasn&amp;rsquo;t ideal. More importantly, I
found out a few days later there was a massive problem that
&lt;em&gt;completely prevents&lt;/em&gt; me from being able to use the power-line
adapters. The house&amp;rsquo;s electrical panel is between the master bedroom
and the office, which is the worst case scenario. One day, we turned
on the washing machine and our internet went down. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t just the
power-line connections that were effected&amp;hellip; the entire network, wifi
and router was essentially being
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack&#34;&gt;dos&amp;rsquo;d&lt;/a&gt; by the
washer. When I unplugged the power-line adapters, it worked
again. Power-line was not an option anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;mesh-network&#34;&gt;Mesh Network&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wondered if there was another way to connect ethernet in my office,
beyond having to drop cat6 cable across the house. I looked into wifi
bridges, but most of the devices were designed for large distances,
and ones for home use were not much better than a power-line adapters
when it came to performance/reliability. While looking at wifi
bridges, a thought occurred to me&amp;hellip; would a mesh network system work?
If the satellite devices had ethernet ports&amp;hellip; maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;netgear-orbi&#34;&gt;Netgear Orbi&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started researching wifi mesh networks, the orbi systems were consistently
rated the highest, and people generally reported that they experienced &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;
performance. When I dug further into it, I learned that this high level of performance was
likely due to the orbi&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netgear.com/landings/mesh-network/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;tri-band wifi
technology&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.
Basically, in addition to the normal 2.4 and 5 Ghz network bands, the orbi
system has &lt;em&gt;a second 5 Ghz band&lt;/em&gt; dedicated to connecting the orbi router and
satilites together. In other words&amp;hellip; a dedicated wifi bridge :D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/switching-to-mesh-network/rbk50.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The RBK50 system comes with 1 router, and 1 satilite
device. Both have 4 etherent ports.&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/switching-to-mesh-network/rbk50.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The RBK50 system comes with 1 router, and 1 satilite
device. Both have 4 etherent ports.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started looking at the orbi hardware and saw that there were several
types of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netgear.com/orbi/products.aspx#filter=.satellites-indoor%2C.satellites%2C.satellites-outdoor%2C.satellites&#34;&gt;satellites&lt;/a&gt;.
Some were just wall plugs, but a few had 2-4 ethernet
ports. Perfect. Realizing this, I ended up ordering the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netgear.com/orbi/rbk50.aspx&#34;&gt;RBK50&lt;/a&gt; system, which
contained a 4-port orbi router, and a 4-port satellite. My hope was that
I could set up the router in the master bedroom with our modem, and
then put the satellite in my office on the other end of the house.
I could then connect my hardwired devices, or even a network switch, into the
ethernet ports on the satellite. Problem sovled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have ordered and setup my orbi system, and will write a review post
about it sometime in the future. This post&amp;rsquo;s intention was mostly to
just explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I ended up getting an orbi system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people have started to use home wifi &amp;ldquo;mesh&amp;rdquo; systems because they
provide a simple solution to cover an entire house with a strong wifi
connection. While this is a great &lt;em&gt;bonus&lt;/em&gt; I get from having the mesh
system, as this post demonstrates, my &lt;em&gt;main&lt;/em&gt; purpose for purchasing
the orbi was to be a solid &amp;ldquo;ethernet over wifi&amp;rdquo; system in the new
house. So far&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s working great.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I Got an iPad</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/getting-an-ipad/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/getting-an-ipad/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering getting a tablet device for the
first time since I was in college. After researching all sorts of options, I
had myself convinced that I would likely be picking up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/ipad-9.7/&#34;&gt;2018 9.7&amp;rdquo;
iPad&lt;/a&gt; at some point. Then I ordered an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro-10-5&#34;&gt;iPad
Pro 10.5&amp;rdquo; (2017 model)&lt;/a&gt;.
Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-a-tablet&#34;&gt;Why a Tablet?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I use technology, I try to plan out and use devices which best fit the
tasks I want to accomplish. After evaluating my work habits, I started to
think that a tablet might function well in many of my use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/keyone.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Blackberry KEYone&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/keyone.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; width: 250px; float: left;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason? I don&amp;rsquo;t like using smart phones. I think modern phones
are a wonderful piece of technology, but they are often misused. While some
smart phone apps can greatly enhance one&amp;rsquo;s life, many are convenient
distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My phone is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; with me, so I keep the set of apps installed on it to a
minimum. I try to use apps that are most needed &amp;ldquo;on the go&amp;rdquo; (maps/lyft,
music/podcasts, and various communication apps). I find that this helps prevent
me from easily distracting myself throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I realized that the experience of some tasks on the phone isn&amp;rsquo;t
great, and that they would likely be best completed on a tablet. Additionally,
setting up a tablet for these apps meant I could still enjoy them in a more
portable way, but maintain a clean, distraction-free phone. Some of the
activities I intended to offload from my phone are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;portable-media-consumption&#34;&gt;Portable Media Consumption&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/youtube-logo.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Youtube Logo&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/youtube-logo.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: right; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually consume the majority of my media either on our TV, or at my computer.
That being said, I did start to notice myself watching Youtube, Hulu, and
Netflix, more often from my phone. This usually occurred when the TV was in use,
or I simply wanted to watch from a different location (ex: my bed). Having a
small screen and tinny speakers, watching video on a phone is terrible.
This is especially true on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gsmarena.com/blackberry_keyone-8508.php&#34;&gt;Blackberry
KEYone&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;even
smaller&lt;/em&gt; screen (Which I choose because it is a great &lt;em&gt;communication device&lt;/em&gt;, with a long
battery life. Regardless, even on a large, bezel-less phone screen, watching video
on a smart phone is still sub-optimal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In college, I used my previous tablet (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_Pad_Transformer&#34;&gt;an Asus Transformer
T101&lt;/a&gt;, with no dock) to
watch videos in my dorm or around campus. I loved it&amp;rsquo;s convenient, but yet
still enticing viewing experience. I assumed that with a modern tablet,
it would only be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being such a visual learner, I tend to gravitate towards visual media. Reading
however, is much less passive than video. When watching a movie, it will
continue to progress whether the viewer is paying attention or not. Reading is
much more &lt;em&gt;self-driven&lt;/em&gt;, which I find helps to build my concentration. As a
result, reading is something I am always trying to do more of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/leanyouahaskell.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Learn You A Haskell for Great Good Book&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/leanyouahaskell.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; width: 260px; float: left; margin: 25px 25px 25px 25px; &#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have owned a kindle paperwhite for years, and it is perfect for reading
books.  However, there are some types of reading material that my kindle falls
simply does not handle well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.humblebundle.com/books/&#34;&gt;Humble Book
Bundles&lt;/a&gt;, I have acquired a collection of
programming, DevOps, system administration, and general technology ebooks. You
know&amp;hellip; the type of book that is &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; classified as a &amp;ldquo;textbook&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;
but does not sound nearly as cool when I call it that&amp;hellip;  Anyway the point
is&amp;hellip; they are &lt;em&gt;horrendous&lt;/em&gt; to read on the kindle. I would love the ability
to flip through a &lt;em&gt;textbook&lt;/em&gt; on a large, color screen, and a tablet enables that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/pocket-logo.svg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Pocket Logo&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/pocket-logo.svg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; width: 175px; float: right; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px; &#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the internet is full of all sorts of &amp;ldquo;articles&amp;rdquo;. News stories, blog posts,
product announcements, opinion pieces, tutorials, reviews&amp;hellip; all litter the
internet. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been starting to corral this craziness by using tools
such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpocket.com/&#34;&gt;pocket&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;save&lt;/em&gt; articles I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to read.
Then, I can come back and batch-read them later. This helps me break the
endless rabbit-hole of digging through, and semi-reading &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;related&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; articles
(half of which aren&amp;rsquo;t even good).  This practice has worked &lt;em&gt;alright&lt;/em&gt; on my
computer, but I do think it would be &lt;em&gt;ideal&lt;/em&gt; to sit down in an
armchair with a tablet in my lap, for my batch reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;offload-some-of-my-smart-phone-use&#34;&gt;Offload &lt;em&gt;Some&lt;/em&gt; of My Smart Phone Use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously stated, my biggest motivation for buying a tablet is to offload
my phone usage to it. This is particularly true for apps which I am &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt;
to use&amp;hellip; but don&amp;rsquo;t need to have access to at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best example of this? Banking and other financial apps. I appreciate the
ease of modern banking, and love that I can simply take a picture to deposit a
check. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t need this on my phone. Not only am I unlikely to be
scanning checks and moving money around my bank accounts in public&amp;hellip; it is not
really safe to be doing so. I&amp;rsquo;d rather just wait until I get home on my own
network, and do my banking from a tablet (which stays at home much more
frequently than my phone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-options&#34;&gt;Other Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;android-tablets&#34;&gt;Android Tablets&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started looking at tablets, I quickly noticed that the market had
changed &lt;em&gt;dramatically&lt;/em&gt; from a just few years ago. While there are still android
tablets &lt;em&gt;available&lt;/em&gt;, the future of Google &lt;em&gt;supporting&lt;/em&gt; android on tablets is a
bit unclear. They appear to be trying to shift everything to ChromeOS, as
demonstrated with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_slate?hl=en-US&#34;&gt;Pixel
Slate&lt;/a&gt;.
Additionally, Android still tends to treat tablets as just a large screened phone, and
applications are often not optimized for it. Understandably, I was a little leery about
Android tablets. As for ChromOS tablets, the Slate is currently the only real
contender, but with it&amp;rsquo;s high price point, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jsqZMCPJts&#34;&gt;lack-luster
reviews&lt;/a&gt;, it was out of the
running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;amazon-fire-tablets&#34;&gt;Amazon Fire Tablets&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/firetablet.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Amazon Fire Tablet&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/firetablet.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; width: 300px; float: right; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px; &#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the pixel slate, at the low end of the tablet market was the
Amazon fire tablet family.  These devices are quite affordable and would work
well for anyone that just wants to read/watch video on a tablet (especially
Amazon content). However, I just felt that the Fire tablet might be a bit too
limiting for me, as I tend to push technology as far as I can.  Beyond that,
the cheaper iterations of each tablet are the &amp;ldquo;special offers&amp;rdquo; ones, which show
amazon ads on the tablet. By the time I had selected a 10&amp;rdquo; tablet &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt;
special offers, the price point started approaching (well&amp;hellip; almost) another
contender&amp;hellip; the 2018 iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-an-ipad&#34;&gt;Why an iPad?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/ipod-video.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Pocket Logo&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/ipod-video.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin: 20px 20px 10px 10px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;my-apple-device-history&#34;&gt;My Apple Device History&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally wanted to do a full &lt;em&gt;multi-paragraph section&lt;/em&gt; detailing my limited
use of apple products throughout my life, and how I only really buy them when
they &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; stand out above the competition. But that would be
pretentious, extremely boring, and quite honestly, annoying. So in short: the
only Apple devices that I have owned are 1) an iPod Video, and 2) iPod Touch.
So why am I willing to get an iPad as my tablet device?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ipad&#34;&gt;iPad&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While researching, I found that the Apple &lt;em&gt;iPad&lt;/em&gt; was consistently
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD1zTrs2EMw&#34;&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7eNq6hTm5E&#34;&gt;as
a&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGkr6Cjr0TI&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;great-value&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3PFt1Y8ZgA&#34;&gt;tablet-device&lt;/a&gt; on the market
today. Most notably, the 2018 entry-level iPad, which
sold for $330 USD, but could often be found on sale for under $300.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aimed at the education market, the 2018 iPad saw a cpu upgrade, and support for
the Apple pencil. The only con I ran into people reporting was that because it
didn&amp;rsquo;t have a laminated screen, there was a bit of a &amp;ldquo;gap&amp;rdquo; between it and the
glass. Despite the minor screen issue, this was still the best device I could find
around that price range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-the-10-5-pro&#34;&gt;Why the 10.5&amp;rdquo; Pro?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/ipadpro.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;iPad 10.5&#34; Pro&#39; src=&#34;../../img/posts/getting-an-ipad/ipadpro.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; width: 350px; float: right; margin: 20px 20px 10px 10px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; why did I end up with the 10.5&amp;rdquo; iPad Pro? The switch happened last minute
the morning I ended up ordering it. My upgrade happened because of
two factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sale&lt;/strong&gt;: The iPad Pro 10.5&amp;rdquo; had gone on a sale at BestBuy, and the
configuration I liked dropped to $499 (from $650). While this was a bit
more expensive, I thought it was still a good deal, and the 2018 iPad
wasn&amp;rsquo;t on sale anywhere so it was the full $330.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features&lt;/strong&gt;: Essentially, the Pro had a slightly larger and &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better display, better speakers, and double the storage space (64GB compared to 32GB). These are features that I don&amp;rsquo;t think most people need to care about, I knew I would really appreciate those features, especially now that I could get them for only a ~$170 increase over the iPad, compared to the normal $310 difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;rsquo;s the history and reasoning as to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I decided to
get a tablet device, and why that device ultimately ended up being an iPad
10.5&amp;rdquo; Pro. It arrived a couple weeks ago, and I have been enjoying it so far. I
think I&amp;rsquo;ll give myself a bit more time with it, before I even &lt;em&gt;attempt&lt;/em&gt; to write any
sort of review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Designing my new Ryzen Workstation</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/charmeleon-desktop-design/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/charmeleon-desktop-design/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years (particularly after moving to the &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/my-t470/&#34;&gt;T470&lt;/a&gt;
as my main device), I have been anticipating what my next desktop
workstation build will look like. For a period of time, I was convinced that
I would build a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.techspot.com/review/1155-affordable-dual-xeon-pc/&#34;&gt;muti-socket, used xeon
build&lt;/a&gt;. Then, in 2017
AMD released their &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen&#34;&gt;Ryzen&lt;/a&gt;
series CPUs&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-a-desktop&#34;&gt;Why a Desktop?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/kadabra-cpu-usage.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Full system monitor on Laptop&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/kadabra-cpu-usage.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;My T470 has been a little tight on resources.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../post/sold-my-bonobo/&#34;&gt;My&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/my-t470/&#34;&gt;laptops&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/my-new-used-x230&#34;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt;
served the majority of my needs these last few years, but I have been feeling
a bit restricted when trying to do more demanding workloads.
While I still side with a &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;use low-powered, portable computers, and remote
into more powerful ones when needed&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; mentality, I enjoy having &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of those
power computers being my physical, main workstation desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;workstation-goals&#34;&gt;Workstation Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/ryzen-logo.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Ryzen Logo&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/ryzen-logo.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;My T470 has been a little tight on resources.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While building a new workstation may be fun, I have particular goals I want it
to achieve. Additionally, it seems like 98% of online build guides are for
designing &lt;em&gt;gaming&lt;/em&gt; desktops&amp;hellip; which is not exactly what I want. So, the
features I wanted in &lt;em&gt;my build&lt;/em&gt;, likely deviate from much of the
&lt;em&gt;suggested&lt;/em&gt; guidance found online, which tends to focus entirely on gaming
performance (more FPS). Here is the breakdown of what I was looking for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;more-cores&#34;&gt;More Cores&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to have workloads that benefit from multiple cores (and threads). For
example, I run a bunch of virtual machines, often at the same time. While my
server&amp;rsquo;s 4 core Xeon handles day to day VMs just fine, it is nice to have a
workstation with several cores to spin up a virtualized cluster across. Beyond
VMs, I compile code, compress/decompress file packages, and occasionally encode
audio/video files. These are all tasks that love having many threads at their
disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;lots-of-fast-ram&#34;&gt;Lots of (&lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;) Ram&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When running VMs, the amount of available RAM is usually more limiting than the
number of cpu cores. For example, when running 6 VM&amp;rsquo;s, my server&amp;rsquo;s 4-core Xeon
will typically be 15-35% utilized, whereas it&amp;rsquo;s 20GB of RAM is nearly full.  If
I want more cores, I should supplement it with lots of RAM. In addition&amp;hellip; I
use electron apps (Slack, Spotify,  etc.) and modern web browsers&amp;hellip; so yea&amp;hellip;. more RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a Ryzen build, the RAM also needs to be &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;.  More than other CPU
architectures, Ryzen CPUs actually &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0SDr3EHHmY&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;run better&lt;/em&gt; with faster
RAM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;fast-storage&#34;&gt;Fast Storage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This main goal of this build is for it to be a multi-tasking beast. If I am
running several VMs and a bunch of applications, utilizing a stack of &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; RAM
to move data around&amp;hellip; I need good &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; storage with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh_f0uof7Jw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=359&#34;&gt;MOAR
IOPs&lt;/a&gt; to
support of these operations, which will all be competing for disk access. While I
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind having space to eventually throw in a pair 3.5&amp;rdquo; rust drives to configure as a
ZFS data pool, the goal for the initial &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; drive of this
machine is the most IOPs I can &lt;em&gt;afford&lt;/em&gt;. So, I ideally &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; a m.2 NVMe SSD,
but &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a normal 2.5&amp;rdquo; SATA SSD at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;some-gaming-ability&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some&lt;/em&gt; Gaming Ability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a &lt;em&gt;gaming machine&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; I would like to be able to
play the &lt;em&gt;occasional&lt;/em&gt; game. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind playing games with lower graphic
settings on my laptops, but I &lt;em&gt;do mind&lt;/em&gt; that even with the lower settings, the
CPUs nearly max out, which spikes up the temperature.
Increased graphics performance would also better support &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-lgud4379b/&#34;&gt;my large
monitor&lt;/a&gt;.  A discrete graphics card would be nice, ideally
an AMD one due to their recent work on improving their open source drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ability-to-upgrade&#34;&gt;Ability to Upgrade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, I want this computer to be a solid &lt;em&gt;base&lt;/em&gt; that I can upgrade
over the next several years. Upgradability is hands-down &lt;em&gt;the main&lt;/em&gt; advantage
of switching to a desktop over a laptop for my main rig. I want this build
designed so that as my needs grow, I can easily max out the RAM, add storage,
or upgrade the CPU and/or GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-build-selections&#34;&gt;Final Build Selections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/charmeleon.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Chameleon Picture&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/charmeleon.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 40%; float: right;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending weeks researching all the parts on the market and building
probably 50 theoretical builds, I eventually settled on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pcpartpicker.com/user/himmelwr/saved/#view=MhbcYJ&#34;&gt;my final part list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;name-charmeleon&#34;&gt;Name: Charmeleon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my last desktop build was named &amp;ldquo;Charmander&amp;rdquo;, I figured &amp;ldquo;Charmeleon&amp;rdquo; was
fitting. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m then free to rename it to &amp;ldquo;Charzard&amp;rdquo; in the future if I &lt;em&gt;evolve&lt;/em&gt;
the build to a next-generation Ryzen 7&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;cpu-ryzen-5-2600-https-en-wikichip-org-wiki-amd-ryzen-5-2600&#34;&gt;CPU: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/ryzen_5/2600&#34;&gt;Ryzen 5 2600&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/ryzen2600.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;ryzen 2600&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/ryzen2600.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 40%; float: left;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I initially wanted a Ryzen 2700, it pushed the build out of budget.
Coming from a 4 core/4 thread system&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s likely that I don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; 8
cores/16 threads right off the bat. Honestly, 4 cores/8 threads would be a
noticeable improvement from what I&amp;rsquo;ve been using&amp;hellip; which is why I first
considered the Ryzen 5 2400g. I planned to start with the 2400g and upgrade to
the 2700 and a GPU once I had more cash. However, &lt;a href=&#34;https://forum.level1techs.com/t/finalizing-an-upgradable-ryzen-linux-build/134670/2&#34;&gt;someone on the level1tech
forums&lt;/a&gt;
reminded me that the 2600 was the same price as the 2400g, and I could get that
plus a GPU for not much more cost (considering I don&amp;rsquo;t need an expensive GPU).
After thinking it over, I realized that was my best option, and should
&lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; fit my needs for quite awhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;motherboard-msi-b450-tomahawk-https-www-msi-com-motherboard-b450-tomahawk&#34;&gt;Motherboard: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/B450-TOMAHAWK&#34;&gt;MSI B450 Tomahawk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/tomahawk.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;B450 Tomahawk motherboard&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/tomahawk.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 40%; float: right;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had selected the MSI B450 Tomahawk after &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxtrHDJUMt4&#34;&gt;Wendell reviewed
it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWGzmbbimPw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=145&#34;&gt;Several
other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMJoLyrWa7E&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=1260&#34;&gt;reviews
confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that it was a solid board, especially for the price. When I was
considering the 2400g, I had to switch to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813144188&#34;&gt;MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon
AC&lt;/a&gt;, because
the Tomahawk didn&amp;rsquo;t have a display output that the integrated graphics could
properly use with &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-lgud4379b/&#34;&gt;my UHD monitor&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s resolution (I need a
display port). When I switched to the 2600, I was able to go back to the
TOMAHAWK, and funnel the cost savings towards getting my GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;gpu-sapphire-1024-4gb-pulse-radeon-rx-560-https-www-techpowerup-com-gpu-specs-sapphire-pulse-rx-560-oc-4-gb-b4627&#34;&gt;GPU: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/sapphire-pulse-rx-560-oc-4-gb.b4627&#34;&gt;Sapphire 1024 4GB PULSE Radeon RX 560&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/rx560.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The KDE Plasma 5 extend display GUI&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/rx560.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 35%; float: left;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, I don&amp;rsquo;t need a killer GPU as I don&amp;rsquo;t play very demanding
games. However, I did want something that could perform at least a &lt;em&gt;little
bit&lt;/em&gt;. So, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=237L9UGQtGk&amp;amp;t=422s&#34;&gt;I picked the rx560 over the
rx550&lt;/a&gt;. At first I planned
to get something like a rx580, which I still might eventually do&amp;hellip; but
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ram-g-skill-trident-z-32gb-2-x-16gb-ddr4-3200mhz-ram&#34;&gt;RAM: G.Skill - Trident Z 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4-3200Mhz RAM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/ram.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The KDE Plasma 5 extend display GUI&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/ram.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 40%; float: right;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to start out with 32GB of RAM, with the ability to easily upgrade to
64GB down the road. This meant that I needed a 2x16GB pack. Additionally, I
needed the RAM to be &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;, but still not &lt;em&gt;overpriced&lt;/em&gt;. Some research showed
that at least right now, &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/lxtrHDJUMt4?t=752&#34;&gt;3200Mhz seems to be the sweet spot, especially for my
particular motherboard&lt;/a&gt;. I originally
picked another kit, but the reviews for it weren&amp;rsquo;t great, so I switched to the
G.Skill kit for only a few dollars more, but with much better reviews. I also
briefly searched for kits with tighter timings, but they were &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more expensive and not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;case-fractal-design-meshify-c-dark-tg-atx-mid-tower-https-www-fractal-design-com-home-product-cases-meshify-meshify-c&#34;&gt;Case: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fractal-design.com/home/product/cases/meshify/meshify-c&#34;&gt;Fractal Design - Meshify C Dark TG ATX Mid Tower&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/meshifyc.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The KDE Plasma 5 extend display GUI&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/meshifyc.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 30%; float: left; margin-bottom: 10px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a case that was sturdy, sleek, but not too flashy or expensive. During my
search, the Fractal Design cases kept catching eye. Eventually, I found the
Meshify C TG Dark, which seemed to be universally loved by reviewers. Additionally,
it appeared to have &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fractal-design.com/home/product/cases/meshify/meshify-c&#34;&gt;good
thermals&lt;/a&gt;,
which I liked. This was my easiest part to pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/chameleon-desktop-design/psu.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The KDE Plasma 5 extend display GUI&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/charmeleon-desktop-design/psu.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 35%; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the power supply, I wanted one that was at least gold rated, and fully
modular. So I searched for the highest rated PSUs fitting those requirements&amp;hellip;
and SuperNova popped up all over the place. At first I picked a 550w model, but
upped to the 650w at the last minute because it was about the same price and
gives me a little more room as I upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;storage-one-of-my-samsung-850-evo-ssds-temp&#34;&gt;Storage: One of my Samsung 850 Evo SSDs (temp)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, storage. For now I am just going to use a spare 250GB Samsung 850 Evo SSD
I had in my test laptop. I plan to eventually upgrade to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/product/consumer/970evo/&#34;&gt;500GB Samsung 970 Evo
m.2 NVMe
drive&lt;/a&gt;,
but the 850 will work for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after months of planing and research, my desktop parts have all been
ordered. Hopefully, it meets the goals I set out to solve, and I will be able
to upgrade it over the next few years&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reset Plasma 5 Monitor Configuration</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/reset-plasma5-monitor-config/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/reset-plasma5-monitor-config/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Extending a laptop&amp;rsquo;s screen to an external display can often be a nightmare.
Sometimes, it might be best to just hit the reset button and configure from
scratch. With KDE Plasma 5, you can. Here&amp;rsquo;s how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;issue&#34;&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I love having a &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/my-t470/&#34;&gt;dock-able laptop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/new-lgud4379b&#34;&gt;my 43&amp;rdquo; 4k LG
monitor&lt;/a&gt;, getting them configured and agreeing with each other
can sometimes be a headache. Luckily, KDE Plasma 5 (the desktop environment
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for awhile now) is fantastic and remembers previous display
configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when I am playing around with resolutions or multiple inputs,
sometimes I set something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work&amp;hellip; and it is remembered, causing
more problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-fix&#34;&gt;The Fix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there is an easy fix: just delete the saved profile, and
re-setup the display again. However, I often forget these very simple steps&amp;hellip;
hence, this post (and to help anyone else that needs it, of course :P).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;delete-old-profile&#34;&gt;Delete old profile&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to delete the plasma profile that saves the screen settings.
Note, this may remove the profiles for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; previously configured displays,
but I am okay with it for &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;cd ~/.local.share
rm -rf kscreen&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;extend-monitors-when-docked&#34;&gt;Extend monitors when docked&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/reset-plasma5-monitor-config/extended-monitor.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The KDE Plasma 5 extend display GUI&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/reset-plasma5-monitor-config/extend-monitor.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The KDE Plasma 5 extend display GUI.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After deleting the config, dock or reconnect the laptop to the display. A GUI
with extension layout options should pop up. If it does, select the preferred
layout option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;close-laptop-lid-don-t-disable&#34;&gt;Close laptop lid (don&amp;rsquo;t disable)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After extending the display, I usually try to make the monitor the primary
display and disable the laptop screen. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work (It causes my
monitor to blank). However, I have learned that if I simply &lt;em&gt;close my laptop
lid&lt;/em&gt; once it is connected&amp;hellip; it does both of those things for me. I always
forget this&amp;hellip; but now it&amp;rsquo;s documented!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;optional-reset-kscreen&#34;&gt;(Optional) Reset kscreen&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After flipping around the displays so much, plasma shell may have gotten a bit
frazzled. If so, just reset it using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;kquitapp5 plasmashell &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; kstart plasmashell&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to execute this in krunner (alt-F2) so that it runs in the background,
and because I can usually still get to krunner, even if something goes terribly
wrong with plasmashell during the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it. While this post is rather short (for once), hopefully it will be useful. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Monitor Selection: My New LG-UD4329b</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/new-lgud4379b/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/new-lgud4379b/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a decade of using several combinations of &lt;em&gt;dual&lt;/em&gt; monitors, I
have decided to upgrade to using a single, but &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;,
monitor. After two years of debating, I have finally made my choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;monitor-history&#34;&gt;Monitor History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/pre-college-monitors.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Pre College monitors&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/pre-college-monitors.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;My monitor setup right before moving to college&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half way through high school, I purchased my first laptop (it also happens to
be the first computer I installed Linux on. I had a special edition model, but it was
very similar to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnet.com/products/hp-pavilion-dv6000/specs/&#34;&gt;this
one&lt;/a&gt;). The laptop was
replacing an old standard E-machines desktop, so I kept the spare monitor to
use with the laptop. From that point on, I &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; had two screens to look
at, even if one was just my laptop&amp;rsquo;s screen at the far end of my desk, with an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)&#34;&gt;AIM&lt;/a&gt; window open in it. Before
moving to college, I built a desktop computer with a new monitor (picture
above), and utilized the old one as a secondary display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/college-desk.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;College Desk&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/college-desk.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 10px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;My desk during my senior year of collage&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout college, as I started to explore Linux and programming more,
I began to experiment with using monitors in portrait orientations.
Eventually, I purchased a second 23.6&amp;rdquo; 1080p monitor so they would
match when paired. This gave me much more vertical real estate, which was
useful when writing code, essays, or lab reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-go-from-two-to-one&#34;&gt;Why go from two, to one?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/homelab/kadabra1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;MA Desk&#34; src=&#34;../../img/homelab/kadabra1.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; padding: 10px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;When using two monitors, I always had to have a primary and secondary.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I like having the &lt;em&gt;screen real estate&lt;/em&gt; of two monitors, I was never able
to optimally use them because of the bezels between the monitors.  While
working, I would naturally shift over and use one monitor as a &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt;
display, and the other as a &lt;em&gt;secondary&lt;/em&gt; display. This was okay for some tasks,
but it usually just meant that I just used the primary monitor, and &lt;em&gt;half&lt;/em&gt; of
the secondary one, because it was too hard to see the far end of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue was &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; better when using my displays in portrait mode, but
that wasn&amp;rsquo;t always ideal when connecting to remote machines, or viewing wide
content (videos, for example). It also didn&amp;rsquo;t solve the main issue. When
looking at the screens in a natural position (head centered, looking strait
forward)&amp;hellip; I still saw two pieces of black plastic. I wanted to see my
&lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; window directly in front of me, with some auxiliary space on either
side for documentation and terminal windows. I wanted a wide screen display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ultra-wide-or-large-16-9-uhd&#34;&gt;Ultra-wide or &lt;em&gt;Large&lt;/em&gt; 16:9 UHD?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the once &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; expensive ultra-wide and large UHD monitors have
started to come down in price. After following the market for a few years, I
narrowed my decision to my favorite choice in each category: The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-34-curved-ultrawide-monitor-u3415w/apd/210-adtr/monitors-monitor-accessories&#34;&gt;Dell
u3415w&lt;/a&gt;
and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-43UD79-B-4k-uhd-led-monitor&#34;&gt;LG
ud4379b&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/dellu3415w.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Dell u3415w&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/dellu3415w.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Dell u3415w 34&amp;rdquo; 3440x1440p Ultra Wide Monitor &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dell u3415w is the slightly older (compared to the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dell.com/ed/business/p/dell-u3417w-monitor/pd&#34;&gt;u34&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt;w&lt;/a&gt;) 34&amp;rdquo;
ultra-wide monitor offering from Dell. It has a 3440x1440, 60 Hz,
slightly-curved, IPS panel sitting on a solid and adjustable monitor stand. I
preferred it over other ultra-wides because it could be found for a reasonable
price, and had a professional build quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on my reasoning explained in the section above, an ultra-wide (1440p
ones&amp;hellip; not 1080p) would fit my mostly programmer use-case very well. Being a
single monitor, I could position it directly in front of me, with my main
code/content centered. The 3440px wide resolution would also allow enough
horizontal space to have a full web page of documentation, and several terminal
windows open on either side of the main display. Lastly, the 1440px vertical
resolution would be an adequate improvement from my &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;starting to feel tight&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;,
1080p monitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/ud4379b.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Dell u3415w&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/ud4379b.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The LG ud4379b 42.5&amp;rdquo; 3440x2160p Monitor&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The massive LG ud4379b is a 42.5&amp;rdquo; 3840x2160px IPS display. At this size and
resolution, it is roughly the equivalent of having four 21&amp;rdquo; 1920x1080px
monitors aligned in a 2x2 grid&amp;hellip; except with 0 bezel between them. Compared to
other 40&amp;rdquo;+ 4K displays, I preferred this one because once again, it was
reasonably priced, had great input options, and also seemed to have a half
decent panel. Reviewers consistently said it had vibrant colors and minimal
back light bleed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being single monitor, I could easily sit myself in front of it, and have my
main content centered, just like with the ultra-wide. Being so large, I could
still have auxiliary windows opened on either side. One advantage the ud4379
had over the ultra-wide however, was that being a massive 16:9 screen, it could
easily be divided into 4 1080p screens. In fact, this model supports spitting
the screen into four separate displays, each taking a different input (more on
that later..). While the ultra-wides often support splitting and
picture-in-picture, it seems more natural on the 43&amp;rdquo; monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;deciding-on-the-43-uhd&#34;&gt;Deciding on the 43&amp;rdquo; UHD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/multi-input.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img
alt=&#34;Shipped Box&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/multi-input.jpg&#34;
style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The LG ud4379 can support
multiple inputs at a time to the single display&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back and forth on which monitor I wanted several times. Eventually, I
realized the long term versatility of the LG monitor was just something I could
not ignore. Being able to use it as one massive display that I could fit
several full VM windows in, or even as 1,2, or 4 discrete monitors makes it
extremely useful for me. I tend to be playing with more than one computer or VM
at a time, and it is VERY nice to have them all fit on a single display. I
&lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; worried it would be a bit &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; large and look stupid on my desk,
especially compared to how slick the ultra-wide would look. However, in the
end, practicality won out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-the-ud4379b&#34;&gt;Getting the UD4379b&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/box.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Shipped Box&#34;
src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/box.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:
100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Monitor arrived a few days later
perfectly safe, despite the beat up box&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After deciding that we would likely order the monitor as my birthday gift, my
wife and I started watching the price a few weeks before. One day, we noticed
the price had dropped $200&amp;hellip; so we ordered it. The price soon went back up, so
I&amp;rsquo;m glad we snatched it when we did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came a few days latter in a massive box that I happily carted up to our
apartment. The box was a bit beat up, but after opening it, all the components
were fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-like&#34;&gt;What I like&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/monitor-working.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Monitor Working&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/monitor-working.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;I can have my main content front and center, with other windows on the sides&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen Resolution&lt;/strong&gt; - The most obvious pro using a monitor at this
size and resolution&amp;hellip; is the screen real estate. As explained above, it&amp;rsquo;s
twice the space of my old, dual 1080p monitor setup. With this space, I can
easily have several source code files, documentation, a few terminals, a
chat window, and even a video opened on my single screen as I work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IPS Display&lt;/strong&gt; - Many people might assume that the driving factor
pushing me to &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; update my monitors was my desire for more screen
resolution. While that was &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of my goal&amp;hellip; what truly motivated me was
a desire to switch to an IPS display on my main setup after almost a year
using my T470&amp;rsquo;s IPS display (which by the way, is &lt;em&gt;not a good IPS panel&lt;/em&gt;).
As someone who spends a large percentage of their computing time in dark
terminals and IDEs, an IPS panel really does help text and colors to pop,
because the darks look &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much better. It turns out, this panel is
actually quite good for it&amp;rsquo;s price, and I am very happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/new-monitor.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Monitor Shading&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/new-monitor.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;When working, I can look straight at a single display and still have enough room.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Monitor, No (center) Bezels&lt;/strong&gt; - As explained earlier in this
post, I like that this is is a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; monitor. This means that I no
longer need to twist my head back and forth, or stare at bezels. I can
looks straight ahead and see my main content, with &amp;ldquo;auxiliary&amp;rdquo; windows
view-able in my periphery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility, multiple inputs&lt;/strong&gt; - Lastly, I enjoy the multiple
inputs and excellent PIP system of this monitor. Combined with something
like &lt;a href=&#34;https://symless.com/synergy&#34;&gt;Synergy&lt;/a&gt;, I can easily use this one
display with several devices at a time. This is great when working with
more than one device, or potentially watching content on something like a
chromecast stick, while still working on the computer. It really is the
advantage of having 4 monitors, but in a single package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt; - They aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;, and I don&amp;rsquo;t use them too often
too often, but for &amp;ldquo;monitor&amp;rdquo; speakers, they really aren&amp;rsquo;t half bad. They&amp;rsquo;re
what you&amp;rsquo;d expect from a TV. However, this means that if I were to use
something like a media stick, the built-in speaker is acceptable enough for
such a device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-don-t-like&#34;&gt;What I don&amp;rsquo;t like&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/monitor-shading.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Monitor Shading&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/monitor-shading.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Viewed from the center, the monitor edges have shadowing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edge Shadowing&lt;/strong&gt; - The one issue that myself
&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/yA6hL3inqRc?t=250&#34;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/3BSaPRHrA_U?t=667&#34;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; have experienced with
this monitor is a sort of &amp;ldquo;edge shadowing&amp;rdquo;. This is apparently
something that is common on monitors this massive, and it&amp;rsquo;s
really hard to engineer around. If I sit back far enough from the
display, you can&amp;rsquo;t see it anymore. (But I don&amp;rsquo;t normally sit like that)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Input Switching Lag?&lt;/strong&gt; - While this is more of a critique of
&lt;em&gt;monitors&lt;/em&gt; in general, one thing I wish was a bit better was the input
switching. Having so many inputs, it can get confusing remembering which one is
attached to what device, or trying to quickly configure a 2x2 multi-input
layout. Having to &lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt; for each device to connect when flipping through all
the inputs makes it that much more frustrating (and disappointing when it&amp;rsquo;s the
wrong input&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corners Out of View&lt;/strong&gt; - Being such a large display, one issue I
sometimes have is that the outside corners are out of my field of view.
I mostly notice this when I occasionally miss notification pop-ups
that I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to see. On the flip-side, notifications don&amp;rsquo;t seem to
distract me as much now when I&amp;rsquo;m trying to focus :P.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/new-monitor-desk.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Monitor Shading&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/new-monitor-desk.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;New monitor on my desk.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I an &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; happy with my new monitor. It fits all of the
criteria I had, and works for my use-case perfectly. While I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
recommend it for a pure gaming machine, it might be one of the best deal
&lt;em&gt;productivity&lt;/em&gt; monitors out there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Living the Dock Life: My Thinkpad T470</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/my-t470/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/my-t470/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous post, I discussed how I sold off my System76 Bonobo laptop, and
 planned to replace it with a new computer. Well, I did&amp;hellip; awhile ago. For the
 last few months, I have been using a Lenovo T470 Thinkpad (with dock) as my new
 daily driver. Here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-choice&#34;&gt;The Choice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/my-t470/coffee-picture.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;T470 Coffee&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/my-t470/coffee-picture.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;My T470 on a Sunday morning&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470-Core-i5-Full-HD-Notebook-Review.198130.0.html&#34;&gt;T470&lt;/a&gt;
is the 14&amp;rdquo; model of Lenovo&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; laptop lineup. The T470 series actually
has several variants itself, including the &amp;ldquo;high end&amp;rdquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470s-Core-i7-WQHD-Laptop-Review.200880.0.html&#34;&gt;T470s&lt;/a&gt;,
that has a slimmer chassis, made from &amp;ldquo;higher quality materials&amp;rdquo;, and a better
screen compared to the T470. There is also the &amp;ldquo;high
performance&amp;rdquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470p-Core-i7-GeForce-940MX-Laptop-Review.226802.0.html&#34;&gt;T470p&lt;/a&gt;,
which features a faster, quad-core CPU, but a slightly larger chassis. While
these variants caught my attention, I ultimately decided on the normal T470.
This was partially because I could max the T470 out at 32GBs of RAM (The T470s
can only hit 24GB due to one of the sticks being soldered in), but mostly
because I assumed that the combination of having a lower powered CPU (compared
to the T70p), but a slightly larger case (compared to the T480s) would make it
the optimal choice concerning my heat/noise concerns outlined in the previous
post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-specs&#34;&gt;The Specs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/my-t470/inside.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Inside T470&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/my-t470/inside.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Guts of the T470&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the T470 then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got my T470 from a vendor on Ebay. It came configured with a 2.5GHz (3.1 GHz
Turbo) i5-7200u cpu, 8 GBs of DDR4 RAM, a 14&amp;rdquo; 1920x1080 screen, and a 500GB Hard
Drive with Windows 10 on it. After checking that it booted up fine, I
immediately swapped the slow HD with the 250GB SSD that was in my x230, and
installed &lt;a href=&#34;https://getsol.us&#34;&gt;Solus&lt;/a&gt; on it. In Solus, everything worked
&amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo;, and I would guess other Linux distributions would as well. For
Christmas, I got a new 500GB Samsung EVO SSD to upgrade the 250GB one. In total,
the T470 has less total storage than the Bonobo had, but &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of it is fast SSD
storage. I am getting better at using my server for network storage anyway, so
it all works out &lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-smile-o&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/my-t470/solus-install.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Solus Install&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/my-t470/solus-install.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Installing Solus the first night&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I still plan to upgrade the T470 in the future, here are it&amp;rsquo;s specs at the
time of writing this post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;T470 Thinkpad
Intel i5-7200u [2.5 Ghz (3.1 Ghz Turbo), 2 Cores, 4 Threads]
8 GB RAM
500 GB Samsung EVO SSD
14&amp;#34; 1920x1080 IPS Display
Solus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardware on the T470 is nice, and the technical specs are &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;, but the
real killer feature of switching to a Thinkpad for my main computer is that I
also purchased the ThinkPad Ultra Dock (40A2). This means that I am able to
&lt;em&gt;easily&lt;/em&gt; take advantage of my periphery devices whenever I am working at my
desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Thinkpad Ultra Dock 40A2
2 x 23.6&amp;#34; ASUS 1920x1080 Monitors
Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro2
Audioengine A2+ Speakers &amp;amp; Stands
Bose AE2 Headphones
Logitech HD Pro Webcam c920 Widescreen
Blue Yeti Microphone - Backout Edition
Inateck USB 3.0 to SATA Dual-Bay Hard Drive Docking Station&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-like&#34;&gt;What I like&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/my-t470/hotel.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;T470 in Hotel&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/my-t470/hotel.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed the portability and great keyboard of the T470&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve provided some background information and a summary, I&amp;rsquo;ll quickly
list what I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;do not like&lt;/em&gt; about my new T470.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cool &amp;amp; Quiet&lt;/strong&gt; - After realizing that I am picky about heat and noise in
computers, one of my biggest goals when replacing my old computer was to find
one that ran cooler and quieter. I think I did well here. &lt;em&gt;This thing is
silent.&lt;/em&gt; Using one of my new favorite command line applications,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://amanusk.github.io/s-tui/&#34;&gt;s-tui&lt;/a&gt;, I have observed that most of the
time when I&amp;rsquo;m writing code, browsing the web, or listening to music, the fans
in the T470 don&amp;rsquo;t even kick on. When I do push the machine a little by
running VMs, or being on a video conference, the do kick up, but even then I
have to put my ear right against the computer to hear anything. At it&amp;rsquo;s
loudest, the T470 is still a very quiet device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size &amp;amp; Portability&lt;/strong&gt; - I love the size and portability of this laptop. The
14&amp;rdquo; form factor is large enough that I don&amp;rsquo;t feel cramped when using it as a
stand-alone device, but still small enough that I can easily throw it in my
bag and bring it with me. While I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind the T470 shedding a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt;
weight (which is mostly from the battery), I find it&amp;rsquo;s thickness perfectly
acceptable for my uses (hear that Apple?). As far as build quality, it is a
solid machine. When I rest my hands on it to type, they feel fully supported
and there is &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; flex. When holding the closed laptop, it feels as though
it could take quite a beating and still be fine. I love that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keyboard &amp;amp; Track-point/pad&lt;/strong&gt; - It&amp;rsquo;s a Thinkpad keyboard, what else do I have
to say? The keys are adequately spaced, have travel (though not as much as my
x230), and feel &lt;em&gt;crisp&lt;/em&gt; when pressed, not mushy. It has a track&lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; with
physical buttons, which at this point I don&amp;rsquo;t think I could do without (Crap.
Unintentional pun. Oh well, I&amp;rsquo;m leaving it.). While I don&amp;rsquo;t use it often, the
track&lt;em&gt;pad&lt;/em&gt; is also quite nice. I find it to be an ideal size, and has
rubberized texture which prevents my fingers from feeling raw after long use.
I find it hard these days for others laptops to compete with the Thinkpad&amp;rsquo;s
keyboard/track-point setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dock-able&lt;/strong&gt; - I&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned this above, but I love that the T470 is
dock-able. This is becoming more common with the pervasiveness of USB-C, but
Thinkpads have been in the dock game for years. It works well, and fits my
current computing use-case perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thunderbolt/USB C&lt;/strong&gt; - The big difference between the T470 and the T460
essentially comes down to the Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port on the T470. I don&amp;rsquo;t
use it much &lt;em&gt;so far&lt;/em&gt;, but I hope the industry continues the move down the this
route, and I will be glad to already have the port as they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battery(s)&lt;/strong&gt; - The battery configuration and life on this laptop is great.
The T470 can get a 3-cell battery that doesn&amp;rsquo;t stick out, or an extended
battery that comes in 6 and 9 cell variations (Note: the 6 and 9 cell are the
same size). The T470 also supports an internal 3 cell battery, that can be
used to keep the laptop powered on while the external battery is swapped. I
currently have the least optimal configuration: A bulky 6-cell external, with
no internal battery. Even so, it easily lasts me throughout the day, and I can
always upgrade it down the road. I love the flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-don-t-like&#34;&gt;What I don&amp;rsquo;t like&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I overall love the T470, there are a few things I&amp;rsquo;m not thrilled about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Screen&lt;/strong&gt; - When I first got my laptop&amp;hellip; I thought the screen was
defective. I had read in reviews that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very &lt;em&gt;bright&lt;/em&gt;, but the colors
were terrible. My screen always looked as if I was using something like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://justgetflux.com/&#34;&gt;f.lux&lt;/a&gt;. After doing some reading, it turns out that
IPS panels (which I had never owned before) can appear warmer in color. That
combined with the low brightness and &lt;em&gt;not great&lt;/em&gt; color accuracy of the T470
panel, made it appear particularly awful to me. I found and configured a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.notebookcheck.net/uploads/tx_nbc2/N140HCA_EAB_01.icm&#34;&gt;ICC
file&lt;/a&gt; which
helped, but the biggest fix was time. As terrible as it was at first, I really
don&amp;rsquo;t mind the screen. Yea, it could be brighter with better colors, but now I
think it looks nice, and colors on top of black really pop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track-point&lt;/strong&gt; - I stated in the section above that the track-point was one of
the features I loved about this laptop. That is true&amp;hellip; but, if I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to get
picky, the track-point itself is not that great. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to move around with
and it&amp;rsquo;s sensitivity differs depending on which direction it is traveling. At
times it can be a real pain. By contrast, my x230 is very stable and precise.
I wish the T470&amp;rsquo;s track-point was like the one on my x230&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graphics&lt;/strong&gt; - I can&amp;rsquo;t complain too much here because I knew what I was
getting myself into, but&amp;hellip; the graphics performance isn&amp;rsquo;t the best. I know
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; having dedicated graphics is what allows the T470 to run cool and sip
power, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; more umph. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to do heavy
gaming on the T470. If I want to game, I am going to build a gaming computer.
However, I do wish I could play basic games a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; better in the meantime.
(&lt;em&gt;On the bright side&amp;hellip;with the thunderbolt 3 port&amp;hellip; an eGPU is a
possibility&amp;hellip;hmmm&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-plans&#34;&gt;Future Plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/my-t470/ram-upgrade.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;T470 Ram Slot&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/my-t470/ram-upgrade.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The empty RAM slot I hope to add a 16GB stick to&amp;hellip; if prices ever drop again&amp;hellip;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I have been very happy with the T470 as my main computer. I&amp;rsquo;d still
like to upgrade the RAM at some point, and I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; entertained the idea of
trying an eGPU setup&amp;hellip; I might &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; build a new desktop, but even then,
I would likely have it headless, running VMs and connect to it remotely from the
T470 (except for occasional gaming). That being said, right now, the T470 is
working great as is!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sold My Bonobo</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/sold-my-bonobo/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/sold-my-bonobo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last fall, I did something I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I would do anytime soon&amp;hellip;. I sold my
main workstation computer. Specifically, my System76 Bonobo Extreme laptop.
Several events over the last year have led me to the realization that my
&lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; computing &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; are drastically different than what they were when I
purchased the Bonobo in early 2015. This post will highlight some of those
realizations, and why I ultimately decided to sell my Bonobo laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-got-the-bonobo&#34;&gt;Why I got the Bonobo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/alakazam.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Bonobo Setup&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/alakazam.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Bonobo Workstation Setup&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought my Bonobo laptop from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.system76.com&#34;&gt;System76&lt;/a&gt; during my
first post-college year. I needed to replace my old workstation: an aging
desktop that I built before my High School graduation. While its i7-930 CPU,
6GB of RAM, NVIDIA GTX 260, and hodgepodge of hard drives (SSD and HHD) serverd
my needs throughout college, I was starting to feel restricted. After some
research, I came to the conclusion that it would be better to get a new system,
instead of trying to upgrade my old desktop. I wanted a new, powerful computer
that could easily run multiple VMs, play some video games, and compile
software/run models &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few months at my new job, I noticed I didn&amp;rsquo;t use a portable computer
as much. I went to work, used my work computer, and then came home to my
desktop. So portability wasn&amp;rsquo;t the &lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; concern when searching. That being
said, I still lived out of state from my family, and would leave for a week or
more at a time during hollidays or vacation. I wanted to still &lt;em&gt;be able&lt;/em&gt; to lug
my computer with me during family vists. I also liked to game &lt;em&gt;a little bit&lt;/em&gt;
when visiting with my brothers, or after work, so I added a dedicated GPU to the search criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/portable-setup.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Portable Bonobo Setup&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/portable-setup.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Portable Bonobo Setup&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this pointed me towards desktop-replacement laptops. I wanted to support
a Linux-only vendoor, so I looked at System76. The Bonobo seemed comparable to
other laptops on the market, but being a System76 device, I felt more confident
all the hardware would play nicely with Linux. It was a big laptop, but my plan
was to use it mostly as a desktop computer, with the option to still travel with
it when I needed to go somewhere for more than just a day or two. Besides, I
liked that the case was larger, as I hoped it would help increase airflow
to help with heat management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I purchased the Bonobo, and it worked out very well for several years. It was a
very powerful computer (more than my old &lt;em&gt;desktop&lt;/em&gt;), but still portable &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt;
for when I wanted to take it somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-modern-reality&#34;&gt;The Modern Reality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/side-view.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Bonobo Thickness&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/side-view.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Bonobo Side View&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the years passed, my computing needs changed. On top of that, some of the
initial assumptions about my computer use turned out to not be entirely true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;i-m-not-a-big-pc-gamer&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Not a Big &lt;del&gt;PC&lt;/del&gt; Gamer.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when my brothers and I would pull out our laptops to play games
together, the games we played were never highly demanding. Our top played games
were Minecraft, Serious Sam 3, Dungeon Defenders, and &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; CS GO. Needless to
say, the Bonobo was a little overkill. Unfortunately, with my brothers and I all
living in different states now, we really don&amp;rsquo;t see each other in person enough
to play computer games in the same room anymore. These days, when we want to
remotely play video games together&amp;hellip; we play on the Xbox ONE (which I bought
mostly to keep in touch with my friends and family. I didn&amp;rsquo;t own one when I
purchased the Bonobo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/xboxone.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;xbox one&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/xboxone.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have enjoyed owning a computer that can handle most of games I throw at
it, but if I&amp;rsquo;m being honest&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t play games too often. Even on the Xbox,
I go in bursts of playing once or twice a week, and then don&amp;rsquo;t touch a game for
months. While I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind having the ability to play more demanding games on
my computer, it isn&amp;rsquo;t a &lt;em&gt;requirement&lt;/em&gt; for me&amp;hellip; expecially on a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;i-travel-more-sometimes-on-airplanes&#34;&gt;I Travel More. Sometimes On Airplanes.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One change compared to when I originally bought my bonobo is that I travel more.
When I first moved to Massachusetts, I figured most of my traveling would be
from here back to Pennsylvania, or to vacation once a year. However, my
wife and I have managed to keep in touch with some of our old friends&amp;hellip; who
live all over the country. Plus, now that my brothers have moved out of
the house, they have started to spread out too (as already mentioned in the
section above). So, I travel more often. In particular, I fly more
frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/tsa.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;TSA logo&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/tsa.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 80%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say it bluntly, the Bonobo sucks to travel with. It takes up the majority of
my bag, and most bags don&amp;rsquo;t even fit it. Besides the laptop size, TSA is often
freaked out by the MASSIVE power supply, and has had to re-scan my bag several
times, thinking I had a &amp;ldquo;bluetooth speaker&amp;rdquo; or something else I neglected to
tell them about (despite my polite warnings that &amp;ldquo;my laptop&amp;rsquo;s power charger is
massive&amp;rdquo;). Beyond security, It isn&amp;rsquo;t a computer I can pull out of my bag
and easily use in an airport terminal. In fact, the last time I flew with it, I
tried to work on it at table, but couldn&amp;rsquo; because the power
outlet didn&amp;rsquo;t supply enough juice to charge the laptop. So, I was
forced to switch to my phone for entertainment while waiting several hours
for my flight, despite having a massive gaming laptop in my bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;it-turns-out-i-m-noise-picky&#34;&gt;It turns out I&amp;rsquo;m noise picky.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When building or purchasing a computer, something to consider is noise. With my
previous machines, I didn&amp;rsquo;t worry about it. I&amp;rsquo;d joke to myself, &amp;ldquo;Noise? Why
should I be concerned about that? I&amp;rsquo;m not building a recording studio&amp;rdquo;! After
several years of focusing on how I &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; use my computing devices, I&amp;rsquo;ve
noticed that I am very picky with noise, and on a related note, heat. Every time
I hear the fans kick up, I start to worry that I am over-taxing the system and
start to monitor the biggest culprits. When running taxing processes, I watch
the cpu temps and hate seeing them high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/temps.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Temp Sensors&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/temps.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 80%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Parallel Compression on the Bonobo Spiked the Temps&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hoped the extra &lt;em&gt;thickness&lt;/em&gt; of the Bonobo would help with any heating issues.
While it might have a little bit, when you shove a decent GPU into a laptop&amp;hellip;
it&amp;rsquo;s going to give off heat. Additionally, when using a powerful CPU to it&amp;rsquo;s
full potential, it is very difficult for a laptop to compete with a
desktop-level cooling system. The Bonobo is a very powerful laptop, but the loud
fans prevented me from actually &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; it to its full potential, because I
would immediately start shutting down processes when the noise kicked up. I know
the fans spin up to &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; with thermals, the Bonobo was just a tad to hot and
loud for my taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-desktop-replacement&#34;&gt;A Desktop Replacement?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My issues with the Bonobo boiled down to the fact that based on &lt;em&gt;my current
computing use-case&lt;/em&gt;, the Bonobo functioned less as a
&lt;em&gt;desktop-replacement-laptop&lt;/em&gt;, and more of just a &lt;em&gt;shitty, somewhat portable,
desktop&lt;/em&gt;. Most of the time, I am just browsing or writing code on the machine in
front of me. If I need more power, I connect remotely to a bigger, better,
computer. I also never game &amp;ldquo;on the go&amp;rdquo;, so if I want to have a computer for
gaming, it makes much more sense to eventually have a half-decent desktop (or
invest in an eGPU), which will fit my needs much better that even high-end
gaming laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/power-cord.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Bonobo Power Cord&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/power-cord.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The power cord alone made it difficult to pick up the Bonobo and move it elsewhere&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bonobo is great if you sit it on a desk and use it as your full computer. I
did not. I have a ton of periphery devices, and started to even use it in
clam-shell mode, making the nice 17&amp;rdquo; screen a waste. Additionally, I hated
having to unplug and re-plug all the devices when I wanted to move the computer.
&lt;em&gt;In theory&lt;/em&gt;, I could move the Bonobo from my desk into the other room and work
with my wife at the kitchen table whenever we wanted, but I &lt;em&gt;rarely&lt;/em&gt; did.
Unplugging all my devices and fishing the massive power cable out from behind my
desk (because the battery life is &amp;hellip; yea, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I need to explain
this), was usually enough to prompt me to treat the Bonobo as a desktop, rather
than a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;recent-discoveries-my-new-plan&#34;&gt;Recent Discoveries &amp;amp; My New Plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back, I bought a &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/my-new-used-x230/&#34;&gt;used x230 Thinkpad&lt;/a&gt;. Last
summer, I finally purchased a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ebay.com/itm/Lenovo-Thinkpad-Mini-Docking-Station-Series-3-USB-3-0-T410-L420-L520-X230-T530/272238176342?epid=562055390&amp;amp;hash=item3f62a8e856:g:PbIAAOSw2x1XMPHU:sc:USPSPriority!02703!US!-1&#34;&gt;used docking
station&lt;/a&gt;
for it, so I could try out a docked setup. I loved it. It matched my needs
exceptionally. I was able to have &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of my periphery devices attached to the
dock and thus, the x230, but with the push of a button I could detach the laptop be
on my way. The setup worked so well in fact, that I started to use my x230 as my
desk computer, and would remote to my Bonobo on the other side of the room when
I needed it. At that point, I realized I might want to switch things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to conclude by again stating that my System76 Bonobo Extreme was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a
bad machine. It is great when used as a standalone, semi-portable computer. I
didn&amp;rsquo;t use it that way, and as a result, it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me anymore. I
learned that a quite, cool, portable, but dockable, laptop is ideal for my main
device &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, even if it isn&amp;rsquo;t as powerful. Unfortunately, System76
doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer such a machine at this time. So, my plan is to replace the Bonobo
with newer thinkpad + dock combination. Hopefully that combination will give me
a nice dock setup that I have grown to appreciate and love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro 2</title>
      <link>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/new-hhkb-pro2/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/new-hhkb-pro2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After years of using a Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite, I have &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; decided to splurge on a Happy Hacking Professional 2 keyboard. And I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I have been slowly chipping away at this post for the last few months. I have been very busy, but I should be able to get back into the swing of writing again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-history-with-the-hhkb-lite&#34;&gt;My history with the HHKB Lite&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/college-computer.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Getting the HHKB Keyboard&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/college-computer.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;My Computer (HHKB lite included) during my senior year of college&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started using Linux during my senior year of high school. In college, I started diving deeper down the rabbit hole, learning more about shells, window managers, and programming. By senior year, I found myself sitting in front of an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.archlinux.org&#34;&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt; install, configured with a tiling window manger to organize the scattering of VIM and VIM-like terminal applications I used every day. To be kind to my wrists, I wanted something that was optimized at the hardware level for my heavy &lt;em&gt;CTRL&lt;/em&gt; key use. This is when I first learned about the HHKB. However, as a broke college student, I opted for the much cheaper &lt;em&gt;lite&lt;/em&gt; version to test out. I enjoyed the layout so much, that years later when I needed to replace a keyboard at work, I had them order me a HHKB lite (again, the Pro was very expensive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;time-for-a-mechanical-keyboard&#34;&gt;Time for a Mechanical Keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of using the standard rubber dome HHKB lite, I wanted to finally switch to a true mechanical keyboard. I searched long and hard, looking at different layouts designs, and learning about the various switch types (mostly the commony &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_(keyboards)&#34;&gt;cherry MX switches&lt;/a&gt;). After purchasing and playing with a switch tester, I confirmed that I would likely enjoy MX clear switches best. They are quiet enough I could still reasonably use them in an office, but still had the nice tactile bump that I love (more than what I experienced on the Browns). Additionally, I knew that I wanted to stick with a small, minimalist layout, so I exclusively looked at &lt;a href=&#34;https://deskthority.net/wiki/60%25&#34;&gt;60% keyboards&lt;/a&gt;, with the occasional &lt;a href=&#34;https://deskthority.net/wiki/40%25&#34;&gt;40%&lt;/a&gt; board catching my eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8wjW-Or1jg8/maxresdefault.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The Pok3r Keyboard&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/pok3r.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Pok3r Keyboard&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many, I eventually landed at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://deskthority.net/wiki/Vortex_Pok3r&#34;&gt;Vortex Pok3r&lt;/a&gt;. It is beautiful, with a minimal, but sturdy appearance, and has a MX clear variant. I had made my decision, but at the time, new boards weren&amp;rsquo;t available. I decided to sit back and wait to see if it would drop on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.massdrop.com/&#34;&gt;Massdrop&lt;/a&gt; any time soon. I had waited years to purchase a mechanical keyboard, and I could wait a little longer to get the one I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-planck-drop&#34;&gt;The Planck Drop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The Planck Keyboard&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/planck.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Planck Keyboard&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was waiting for a Pok3r drop&amp;hellip; something interesting caught my eye on Massdrop&amp;hellip; the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.massdrop.com/buy/planck-mechanical-keyboard&#34;&gt;Planck keyboard&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; The planck is a keyboard kit that you solder together to create a programmable, &lt;em&gt;ortholinear&lt;/em&gt;, 40% keyboard. When I say &lt;em&gt;programmable&lt;/em&gt;, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean that you can just bind some keys. The Planck is fully open and the firmware C code is available on Github for modification. So, you can actually customize and hack together the firmware, which was very appealing to me. So I joined the drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After joining, I purchased a soldering kit so that I could construct the keyboard once it finally shipped. Unfortunately, the planck drop had &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; delays, but as I previously stated, I didn&amp;rsquo;t waiting. The planck got delayed &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much, that they eventually allowed people to cancel their order and receive a refund. I thought the order cancellation was something you &lt;em&gt;opted in&lt;/em&gt; to do, but it was actually an &lt;em&gt;opt out&lt;/em&gt; situation&amp;hellip; so my lack of response had my order canceled, pre-maturely ending my planck experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;deciding-on-the-hhkb-pro&#34;&gt;Deciding on the HHKB Pro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my planck order canceled, and a refund imminent, I started to look at other options again. The main contender was still the Pok3r. I started researching it again and learning about how I could program the layers to have a layout I would like&amp;hellip; and eventually realized I just kept re-creating the infamous HHKB layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started to consider the HHKB again. My main reasons for not getting it originally was that it is a good bit more expensive than the majority of mechanical keyboards on the market. However, after waiting months for the planck, and noticing I kept comparing everything to the HHKB, I realized I would eventually end up with an HHKB anyway, and decided to just go for it now. Decision made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-the-hhkb&#34;&gt;Getting the HHKB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/got-hhkb.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Getting the HHKB Keyboard&#34; src=&#34;../../img/posts/new-hhkb-pro2/got-hhkb.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;My HHKB&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I decided on the HHKB, (and it was approved by my wife :P ), I purchased it on Amazon. The one thing I did contemplate about was which color to get. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if I wanted to get the black or white model. I knew I wanted printed key-caps, and that made the white board very appealing. The printed keys on it look &lt;em&gt;so crisp&lt;/em&gt;. Eventually, I decided on the dark gray because it matches everything else I own, whereas the white board would drastically stick out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I placed the order and within a few days, it was on my doorstep (well, the neighbor&amp;rsquo;s, but that&amp;rsquo;s an issue with our post&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-like&#34;&gt;What I like&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;layout&#34;&gt;Layout&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As already mentioned, I love they HHKB layout. It was a bit tricky to get accustomed to at first, but that was &lt;em&gt;several years&lt;/em&gt; ago at this point. The HKKB Pro does have a few difference in layout when compared to the lite version (the pro does not have a bottom left &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; key, or any dedicated arrow keys). However, I had prepared myself for this change over the last few years by only using the right &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; key and the &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; arrow keys. The hardest thing to adjust to was the slightly different sized &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt; keys on the left (due to the missing &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; key).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have learned to appreciate all the little HHKB layout differences. This includes the &amp;ldquo;delete&amp;rdquo; by default backspace key, with the &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; key above it, and the &lt;code&gt;ESC&lt;/code&gt; key next to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. Last but not least, &lt;strong&gt;the CTRL in the CAPS location&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(with CAPs still available as &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;Tab&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. I honestly think this should be the standard keyboard layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;pbt-key-caps&#34;&gt;PBT key-caps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect the PBT key-caps to be such a big deal, but I absolutely love them. I could tell from images that they would &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; better (especially the white ones), but I didn&amp;rsquo;t anticipate how great they would feel. They are solid, but with a soft touch, and are a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better improvement over every keyboard I have previously owned/used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-switches&#34;&gt;The Switches&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how I would like the topre switches after getting excited for Cherry MX clears. However, I seem to really like them&amp;hellip; at least on the HHKB. I have heard that they feel different on the HHKB compared to other Topre keyboards due to the HHKBs plastic back. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this is true or not, but I like the result. Key presses are smooth but at the same time very crisp. Being a heavy typist, I often bottom out, but when I do it feels very soft, and not harsh at all. I figure that if I am going to bottom out on my keys regardless of what keyboard I have, it is probably best to handle it how the HHKB does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;can-i-say-sound&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip; Can I say sound?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the sound of typing on this keyboard. While it is definitely an audible keyboard, it isn&amp;rsquo;t nearly as obnoxious as louder clicky switches, like MX Blues or Greens. It has a soft, muted, lower pitched sound as I type (compared to normal &amp;ldquo;clicky&amp;rdquo; switches). I really do enjoy hearing it, and find myself sometimes taking off my headphones to listen to it if I need motivation to get more characters on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-don-t-like&#34;&gt;What I don&amp;rsquo;t like&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;cost&#34;&gt;Cost&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned earlier in the post, probably the &lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; downside to the HHKB is the substantial cost. At &amp;gt;$230 USD, it is expensive, even for mechanical keyboards. The cost is the single problem that kept me from buying it all these years. Eventually, I realized it is what I wanted, and it would likely last me &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;, so it all works out. Additionally, if I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the PRO, or didn&amp;rsquo;t want it anymore, they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have an incredible resale value, so I could likely get a large chunk of my money back fairly easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;transporting-it-related-to-cost&#34;&gt;Transporting it (related to cost)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the cost issue is mitigated after just biting the bullet and hitting the &amp;ldquo;check out&amp;rdquo; button, there is another minor annoyance that is &lt;em&gt;related&lt;/em&gt; to the high price. Ideally, I&amp;rsquo;d like to use my HKKB whenever I am at the computer. Being a software developer&amp;hellip; I use a computer for 8+ hours a day at work. So, I like to use my keyboard at work&amp;hellip; but I also like to bring it home. Ideally, I&amp;rsquo;d get two: one for home and one for at the office. At the high price point though&amp;hellip; I might have to wait to make that purchase. As far as keyboards go, I&amp;rsquo;d say the HHKB is probably one of the best travel boards out there. It&amp;rsquo;s light, but sturdy, and there is even a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Carrying-Happy-Hacking-Keyboard-PD-KB01SD/dp/B000FHSNFW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1514499138&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=HHKB+case go&#34;&gt;travel case designed specifically for it&lt;/a&gt;. So far I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the box to transport it, but am going to get the traveling case soon. That should hold me over until it is justifiable to get a second board. One day&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I actually was just gifted the carrying case for Christmas. I will check out how it works in the new year. It should at the very least be better than the cardboard box it came in&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;mac-mode-delete-fix&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mac&amp;rdquo; mode / Delete &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One benefit of getting the HHKB &lt;em&gt;Pro&lt;/em&gt; over the &lt;em&gt;lite&lt;/em&gt; version, is that it has some media key functionality (volume, start/stop). However, these keys only work when the dip switches are configured to put the board in &amp;ldquo;Mac mode&amp;rdquo;. In addition to enabling the media keys, it changes a few other things, like changing the iconic HHKB &amp;ldquo;Delete&amp;rdquo; key to a more traditional &amp;ldquo;Backspace&amp;rdquo; default. Now, I understand that 99% of people probably welcome this change with open arms. However&amp;hellip; after using the HHKB lite for so many years, I have &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; become accustomed to the &amp;ldquo;delete&amp;rdquo; key there, and actually prefer it now. With how I jump around my editor/terminals with emacs bindings, I have actually developed a workflow where I use &lt;em&gt;delete&lt;/em&gt; more often than &lt;em&gt;backspace&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot figure out a way to have &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;mac mode&lt;/em&gt; and &amp;ldquo;delete key default&amp;rdquo; functionality enabled at the same time. So&amp;hellip; I have opted to just forgo the new media keys, which is unfortunate. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice upgrade from the &lt;em&gt;lite&lt;/em&gt; version, and a shame I can&amp;rsquo;t take advantage of it just because I &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; the default layout of the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;missing-more-modern-features-perks&#34;&gt;Missing more &amp;ldquo;Modern&amp;rdquo; Features/Perks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HHKB being a &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;classic&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, seems to be lacking in some of the more &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; features of high-end keyboards. There is no backlighting, no custom programming/macro setups, or wireless connectivity. I even believe that the two USB ports on the back are USB 2, not 3 (let alone C). While it would be &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; to have some of these features in the HHKB, I&amp;rsquo;m not hurting &lt;em&gt;too badly&lt;/em&gt; for them&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;. A modern refresh would be amazing though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it is a great keyboard and I plan to use it for a long time. Typing on it feels and sounds so natural, and it has the same layout I have grown to love over the last few years. I am thrilled to finally upgrade to the pro, and wish I did so years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
