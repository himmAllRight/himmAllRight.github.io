      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I continue to learn more and more programming languages, I am somewhat ashamed to admit that I have yet to learn C. However, it is not because I am trying to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-reason&#34;&gt;The Reason&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C is one of the top languages I wish to know, and know well. C is the backbone for so much code, especially in the Linux ecosphere that it is almost imperative for one to at least understand it. I keep trying to poke my head into open source projects, and so many of them are built or based on C (especially when looking at projects more at the distro and distro applications level).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this spring I will start working on my CS MS degree, and while I think the first course I take will be theory based, I know several other courses that will require it (ex: computer architecture and compilers). Being comfortable with C will allow me to focus on the topics, and not on the syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some experience with C++ from my software engineering course I took during undergrad, but that is about it. My goal however is to understand just plain C, which will hopefully make implementing other C-based languages such as C++ a bit easier. My ultimate goal is to eventually have C be one of my top 3 languages (I&amp;rsquo;m thinking LISP, C, and maybe python or ruby. I know. I&amp;rsquo;m old school.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-plan&#34;&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks, I have set up and started looking at Learn C the Hard Way. I read the first section or two, but haven&amp;rsquo;t been consistent with working through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that it is December, I thought I should maybe start a new monthly challenge, or even a &amp;ldquo;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; days till something&amp;rdquo;. I was thinking about things I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to constantly work on the last few months, and C popped into my head. Learn C the Hard Way fits particularly well because it is broken down nicely into small segments that I can maybe commit to being able to finish 1 per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to look ahead a bit to see if this challenge is doable, but i think that as of now, the plan is to try to complete at least 1 (I can work ahead if I want to) segment of the book a day for the month of December. I am also going to allow myself the ability to &amp;ldquo;pre-cache&amp;rdquo; segments ahead of time so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to pull away and work on it during the holidays if I don&amp;rsquo;t want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think this is a good plan that should allow me to start getting some C experience under my belt. I&amp;rsquo;ll be sure to update in the future with how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update&#34;&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now that I have made it a good bit through the month, I must admit that I have not adhered to this challenge very strictly. I have done many of the exercises, but I have fallen somewhat behind. Basically, I accomplished a bunch of other things and let this challenge slide. I will continue to work on it, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to keep with with the one exercise per day rate. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
