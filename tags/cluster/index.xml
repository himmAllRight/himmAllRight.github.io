      <title>Updating the Pi Cluster with Ansible</title>

      <description>With Ansible configured on the Pi cluster, it is time to have it do something useful. When working with a clustered system, even the simplest tasks become tedious and time consuming. For example, updating the system. While I could manually update each of the 3 pi nodes, it is not scalable to 10 or 30 nodes, let alone hundreds or thousands. Tools like Ansible, make doing tasks such a supdating clustered systems, trivial again.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;http://ryan.himmelwright.net/posts/Setting-up-the-pi-cluster/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I pieced together my &lt;a href=&#34;http://ryan.himmelwright.net/pages/homelab/#cluster&#34;&gt;pi cluster&lt;/a&gt;, and installed variations of Ubuntu 16.04 Server on each of its nodes. With the cluster built, I quickly needed an easy way to maintain and interact with the system as a whole. This, is where &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ansible.com/&#34;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt; comes in. In this post, I will walk through the steps I took to setup Ansible on my Cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setting Up My Pi Cluster</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a Raspberry Pi 2, a Raspberry Pi 3, and a Banana Pi. A while ago, I constructed a small tower to house my pi devices. Since then, I have additionally acquired a power source, and some CAT6 cable to connect them all up to a switch. I hope to use the Pis as a mini clustered environment, where I can learn (and play) with some of the &amp;ldquo;Devops&amp;rdquo; technologies/techniques out there. This post will briefly explain the initial setup of &lt;a href=&#34;../../pages/homelab/#cluster&#34;&gt;my cluster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
