      <description>Notes for Postgresql
Install Just installed from the repos at first&amp;hellip; was in Solus.
Pulling down for latest Went to website and got commands to pull down latest for Centos (I&amp;rsquo;m using an lxc container). The website has you choose what system you are on, and customizes the commands for you, which is nice :) .
